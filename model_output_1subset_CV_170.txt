Description:  In this counterscreen, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene, but lacking the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion that was present in the primary screening cell line (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to off target effects. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep(Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well.  Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]).  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the pGL-3 LUC gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL compound, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.  The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Experimental Protocol: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 2X stock concentration in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent.  Acetylcholine CRC serial dilutions were prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a one of eight concentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for the Acetylcholine CRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence of a fixed concentration of test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compounds with a calculated EC50 at 10uM were assigned as 'Active' and given a score of '100'. All other compounds were assigned as 'Inactive' and given a score of '0'.

Description:  Counterscreen using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells to identify inhibitor of the proteasome pathway. The small molecules reducing the cleavage of peptide linked with luciferin and measured by the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin and light (luminescence) mediated by the luciferase will be considered as an inhibitor. Expected Outcome: Identification of compounds inhibiting the proteasome pathway. More specifically, compounds diminishing the luminescent response (RLU) greater than 50% of the signal in a dose response obtained from the in-plate positive control (MG132, 1 microM) added to the negative control (DMSO) will be considered as hits. Proteasome inhibition (Chymotrypsin-GLO, Promega) Counterscreen assay in U2OS cells: The U2OS (ATCC, HTB-96) cell line is propagated in DMEM media (Invitrogen, SKU 11995) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Denville Scientific Inc, Cat. No. FB5001-H) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016) at 37C in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening assays, cells are grown in T175 flask (BD Falcon, Ref 353112) or Hyperflasks (Corning, Cat 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using 7 or 75 ml Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (Cellgro, Cat. No. 25-053-CI) for 5 minutes and then the trypsin is inactivated with 7 or 75 ml of complete medium respectively. Cells should not be trypsinized more than 10 minutes because massive cell death will start to occur. Cells are centrifuged at 1000rpm/5min and resuspended in fresh complete DMEM media with phenol (Invitrogen, SKU 11995) as mentioned above (for normal cell propagation) or DMEM medium without phenol (Cambrex; Cat. No 12-917F) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016). Cell number is counted using a Nexelcom Bioscience cell counter (Cellometer(r) Auto M10) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS. Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform BL2 automation unit: Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  U2OS cells are harvested and resuspended in DMEM without phenol (Cambrex, 12-917F) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Denville Scientific Inc, Cat. No. FB5001-H) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen,10378-016). U2OS cells (from an initial cell suspension of  50,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, Cat.No. 8867BC) at a final density of 2,500 cells per well in final volume of 50 &#956;L. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing. 2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) BL2 automation unit and  incubated for 24 hours at 37C in the Liconic CO2 incubator (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate and reading on Envision): 3.The dose plate containing the positive control compound (MG132, BRD-K60230970-001-05-0) (12 different concentrations starting at 0.25 mM and diluted 2 fold on each subsequent well), vehicle (Base plate, DMSO) and the Cherry pick plate (20 plates total) (5 different concentrations starting at 16.5 mM and diluted 3 fold on each subsequent) are pulled from Walkup refrigerator. First, the base plate and the dose response plate are pinned twice using 384 well pin tool (100 nl) on pin table (BL2) and transferred to assay plate. Pins are washed with methanol and DMSO between each pinning. Second, the Cherry Pick compounds plates are pinned twice into one assay plate (duplicate).   Finally, a second round of the base plate and the dose response plate pinning is achieved at the end of the run. 4. After the pinning has occurred, the assay plates treated with compounds are moving back to Liconic CO2 incubator to be incubated for an additional 4 hours. After 3h30, each assay plate is pulled out of the incubator and cooled down at room temperature for 30 minutes. 30 &#956;L/well (384 well) of Proteasome-Glo (Chymotrypsin) reagent 0.5X (diluted in H2O) (Promega, G8661) is dispensed using the the MultiDrop Combi/tubing dispensing cassette from Thermo Scientific. The assay plate returned to room temperature for  2hrs to allow a complete cellular permeabilization and maximum signal. 5. Luminescence is measured in each well (0.1 second/well) using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting) (Standard luminescence).

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to measure p97 ATPase inhibition" (PubChem AID 1481), and that confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the p97 ATPase" (PubChem AID 1517). This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Prior to the start of the assay 18 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2, rows O and P of 384-well assay plates. The remaining wells were filled with 18 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM p97 protein. Next, 50 nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 100 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 20 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 24 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and luminescence was measured by the Envision microplate reader.

Description:  Cultured human SKBR-3 breast tumor cells were treated with test compounds from a 10,000 compound library (in duplicate) for 18-24 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM. Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminesence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control. Average growth inhibition values were calculated based on two separate experiments. Compounds that reduced cell viability in both assays to less than or equal to 10% or were scored as active, while compounds which cause less than 90% growth inhibition were scored as inactive. Compounds that reduced cell viability in only one assay to less than or equal to 10% were scored as inconclusive.

Description:  Luciferase (Kinase-Glo, Promega Corporation) was assayed for its ability to generate light using ATP and luciferin as substrates. The ATP concentration in the assay (10 uM) was within the linear range of enzyme activity for the assay conditions used. This assay was used as an counter screen for human pyruvate kinase M2 isoform. Four uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 10 uM ATP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white 1536 well plates. Twenty-three nL of compound was delivered by a pin tool and 2 uL of luciferase detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega)) was added. Following 8-minute incubation at ambient temperature, luminescence was measured by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 seconds exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (40 uM SIB 1757) and curve fitting was performed using Hill equation.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play vital roles in numerous cellular processes and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases, ranging from cancer to cardiovascular, immunological, infectious, neurological, and metabolic diseases. The Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) PTP is a dual-specific Erk and Jnk phosphatase, the loss of which causes specific cell cycle arrest in HeLa carcinoma cells, suggesting that VHR inhibition may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer cells without detrimental effects on normal cells. Recent studies by collaborators and us suggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is, like VHR, a dual-specific phosphatase and structurally closely related to VHR. MKP-1 also shares a physiological substrate with VHR, namely the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2.  Therefore, MKP-1 was chosen to assess the selectivity of the VHR1 inhibitors reported in AID 2004. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of an inhibitor. The MKP-1-catalyzed hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of compound was assayed at 30 degree Celsius in a 60 ul 96-well format reaction system in 150 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0 assay buffer having an ionic strength of 150 mM (adjusted with NaCl) and containing 1 mM DTT and 5% DMSO.  With a MKP-1 (Upstate cat. #14-391) concentration of 0.166 nU/ul, and at various concentrations of the compound (between 1 nM and 100 uM), the initial rate at 134 uM DiFMUP concentration (Km value) was determined using a FLx800 micro plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), an excitation wave lengt0h of 360 nm and measuring the emission of the fluorescent reaction product 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (DiFMU) at 460 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme.  The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 1 using the software GraphPad Prism?(GraphPad Software, Inc.). Vi/V0 = IC50/(IC50 + [I])  (Eq. 1) In this case, Vi is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I], V0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki[S]/Km.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine the parental Ba/F3 cell line cytotoxicity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (PubChem AID 1446), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for inhibitors of mutant JAK2V617F: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of parental Ba/F3 cell viability" (PubChem AID 1486). In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit cell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.6 uM. The murine Ba/F3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1ng/mL IL-3, and 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red free RPMI supplemented as above except with 2ng/mL IL-3. The assay was started by dispensing 5 ul of cell suspension to each well. Next, 28 nL of test compound (5.60 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.56 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (5.6 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 5 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by project collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30 nanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. This design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is associated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead sets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635 nm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7 might be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead control (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a fluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the test compounds. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of 218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds. RGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of the measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative control bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that particular protein is "inconclusive", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS Protein is "inconclusive", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant amounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702 compounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound (|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. RV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and RGS7, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library dependent "edge effect" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the data set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered "Active". Data from compounds located in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than 0 or greater than 135 were considered "Active". Active compounds include both activators - where %Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the 218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as potential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per protein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are RGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific. RGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel, which can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has the lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest bead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead set, the compound is flagged as "Potential Red Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as potential red fluorescent compounds. The Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library, average Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when excluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard deviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for target RGS16, due to the library dependent "edge effect", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68 standard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity of the protein. For easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the same compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an activator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column Ri_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where "i" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for S1P4 agonists: Cell-based dose response high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1509), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1523). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether these compounds are nonselective agonists due to activation of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta- arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 625,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (5 uM final concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA, was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control)) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing S1P. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 51 and active compounds range of activity score is 54 to 100.

Description:  Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 agonism activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1509). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 5 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation =100* (1-((Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5&#956;M S1P Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 11 and active compounds range of activity score is 13 to 100.

Description:  A modified strain of Vibrio harveyi with constitutive on quorum sensing system will be exposed to small molecules identified from the HTS screen used to identify LuxS inhibitors and LuxPQ antagonists. Growth of the organism post exposure will be followed using optical density and disruption of down stream quorum sensing elements will be observed  based on decreased luminescent signal. Expected Outcome: Identification of AI-2 quorum sensing system inhibitors with modes of action which either antagonize the LuxPQ receptor or inhibit LuxS synthase.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-002) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation by the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and was assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration, 0.1 nM pyruvate kinase, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Cambrex) was added, the plates centrifuged, and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme or 110 uM N-methyl-2,3-diphenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-imine; CID: 682802; LOPAC-S-4063). To monitor activation, 0.3 nM pyruvate kinase was included in one control column.

The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the SH-SY5Y cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation.  Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. In the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and determine potency. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Test compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. Beads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt, Rac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine different concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data points. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand concentrations, generating competition curves. Ligand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. In order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) - [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be statistically significant) - |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of LOGEC50) - |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE) - [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test compound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) - [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the compound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 - ||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|) In this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive compounds the activity score is 0.

Description:  To measure 5-HT1E antagonism, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was developed at the Scripps Molecular Screening center. This line contained the human 5-HT1E receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15, and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. When cells were challenged with the selective 5HT1E agonist BRL-54443, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 6 micromolar final concentration. The results of the potency assay will be published in a future submission. The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The HTS assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 30 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of BRL-54443 (Sigma part B173)in 1X phosphate buffered saline (Invitrogen, part 14190144) was added to all test compound wells (i.e. negative control wells)at approximately its EC95 concentration. Positive control wells were treated with one microliter of 1X phosphate buffered saline only. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added to all wells. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, plate fluorescence was measured with the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm.

Description:  Injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity after the prolonged seizures termed status epilepticus (SE). Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) activation by ischemia and SE generally contributes to neuronal injury, but multiple downstream COX2 signaling pathways, and our data, suggest that the mechanisms promoting and opposing brain injury are complex. EP2 is a Gs-coupled GPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP. We created a rat C6 glioma cell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under control of the CMV promoter. Thirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM butaprost (a selective EP2 agonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to cause cAMP accumulation in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The subclone chosen for further study responded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from 0.057 to 58 fmoles / 6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to butaprost or the endogenous ligand, PGE2 (not shown). The primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a cAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF assay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with butaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, reduces the FRET signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was carried out for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for manipulating cell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12 hours after lysing the cells. A cell density of 6000 to 9000 cells/well in a 384-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics, with Z' >0.75 and S:N > 15. The assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is approximately 7-fold more potent than butaprost, and will be used in HTS because the action of allosteric modulators is frequently influenced by the agonist chosen. Finally, over the two month optimization period the Z' and S:N remained sufficiently robust for screening. Reagents: Cell culture medium:  500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen Strept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml  Geneticin Procedure: 1. Grow cells: Cells were grown over a week in T-175 flasks and split when appropriate to reach the final volume of 40-50 T-175 flasks necessary for screening. 2. Harvest cells: 1. Aspirate medium from T-175 flasks, rinse with HBSS without Ca-Mg. 2. Add 3 ml /flask Versene (EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml) (BioWhittaker Cat# 17-711E) 3. Tap flasks vigorously 4. Add 10 ml/flask HBSS (+Ca+Mg) and combine the cells in 4 centrifuge tubes (50ml) 5. Centrifuge cells at 800g for 8 min 6. Discard supernatant 7. Resuspend cells in about 100 ml HBSS(+Ca+Mg) 8. Count cell number 3. Cell density optimization Make dilutions of PGE2 in HBSS to arrive at testing concentrations of PGE2. Make dilutions of cells to arrive at testing concentrations of cells. Add 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9 in HBSS) and incubate at RT for 10 - 40 min Add 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1:18), centrifuge plate and incubate at RT for 20min to 2 hr Read FRET signal using Envision (100us delay) Analyze data and calculate the EC50s at different cell density Choose cell density for screening (EC50 of PGE2 is 1 - 3 nM) 4. Screening Step 1: make 250 ml of cells (for 40 1536-well plates), add 250 ul of 10 mM Rolipram Step 2:  dispense 4 ul of cells to column 3 - 46 Step 3: dispense 1 ul of HBSS to column 3 - 4 Step 4: add 0.1 ul of 1 mM compound (final compound concentration: 20 uM) using Pin-tool (Beckman NX) Step 5:  add 1 ul of 6 uM PGE2 to PGE2 control wells (final 1 uM) Step 6: add 1 ul of 120 uM Forsklin to forsklin control wells (final 20 uM) Step 7: dispense 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9) to column 4 Step 8: make mixture of d2-conjugate and PGE2: Step 9: dispense 2 ul of d2-conjugate and PGE2 mixture to column 5 - 46 step 10: shake plates well, centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10min, incubate at RT for around 10mins (no longer that 20 min) Step 11: dispense 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1: 18 dilution in lysis buffer) to column 3 - 46 Step 12: shake plates well,  centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10 min and incubate at RT for 10 min. Put plates to 4C refrigerator before reading Step 13: Read plates using Envision with Twister II robot. Run 5 plates/batch from refrigerator. 5.  Data analysis: Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate. Normalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET blank(compound added)) / ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (no compound added)) % of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from control wells) * 100 % of inhibition = 100 - % of activity Where FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an average FRET ratio from wells with cells, Anti-cAMP-Eu and HBSS buffer only; FRET control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing 0.3 nM PGE2 that defines maximum FRET signal. Percent induction is then calculated based on a comparison with wells containing 1 uM PGE2: % induction = (Pct Inhibition Compound / Pct Inhibition 1 uM PGE2) * 100 The PubChem Activity Score is calculated by rounding the Pct Induction to 0 decimal places. Negative scores are changed to 0, and scores higher than 100 are changed to 100. Compounds with a PubChem Activity Score > 60 are defined as active.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P1 receptor (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct was used. Cells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/ml Geneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.3 million/mL in phenol red free DMEM containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of the assay plates. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates for 20 hrs at 37 C in 5% CO2. Then 10 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One ul of forskolin was dispensed to all compound and negative control wells at a final concentration of 2 uM. Additionally, 1.1 uL of 10 uM SEW2871 was added to designated positive control wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm.  The ratio of fluorescence intensity, Ex 590/Ex460 was used to calculate Percent Activation as described by the following mathematical expression: %Activation = 100* [1-((test compound well ratio - median ratio of positive wells) /abs(median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells))] Where: Test compound wells are defined as wells containing test compound from the Maybridge library and forskolin Positive control wells are defined as wells containing 1 uM SEW2871 and 2 uM forskolin Negative control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  eIF2B is a translation initiation factor that functions in the first step of protein synthesis. It is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), converting eIF2 (inactive GDP-bound form) to eIF2GTP (active). Mutations of eIF2B manifest as a dysfunction in brain myelin leading to its progressive loss. This causes fatal conditions known as Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination syndrome (CACH) and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM). As eIF2B is a universally conserved protein among eukaryotic organisms, a cellular assay system has been developed using yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild type and eIF2B-epsilon-R284H mutant). Yeast eIF2B-epsilon-R284H is equivalent to the human eIF2B5-R299H mutation. The HTS is aimed at identifying compounds that can restore eIF2B function. The screen is a reporter-gene assay. GCN4 activity is inversely proportional to eIF2B function in cells. Thus cells with eIF2B mutations exhibit aberrantly high GCN4 expression. The mutant cells contain a chromosomally-integrated gene-fusion to beta-galactosidase. Beta-Galactosidase monitoring thus indirectly measures GCN4 levels and, in turn, eIF2B activity. To perform the assay, we have adapted a coupled beta-galactosidase/ firefly luciferase system (Promega) for use with yeast cells and in HTS format. The growth of mutant and wildtype yeast in the presence of each compound was also monitored and used as a measure of compound toxicity. Mutant yeast cells were grown in 384-well polypropylene plates sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes at 30 C for 16 hrs. After 16 hrs, the cells were mixed using Perkin Elmer Evolution by repeated aspirate-dispense cycles using 30 uL disposable tips. A portion of the cell suspension was lysed with Z-buffer (82 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 9 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1% SDS) in a white 384-well plate. Beta-Glo reagent was added to the lysed cells, and luminescence was measured after 90 min. at room temperature. The remaining cells were transferred to a clear 384-well plate and absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Perkin Elmer Envision spectrophotometer. HTS was performed using 25 uM compound as described below. The screen was repeated using the wild-type yeast cells as a filter to identify compounds having a non-specific effect on the luminescence of both mutant and wild-type yeast.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resultinged from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pomrope patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significant increasesd the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones. This assay attempted to confirm hits from the primary screening using an alternate fluor than the primary screen used. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with resorufin-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and recombinant human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, resorufin, can be excited at 573 nm and emits at 610 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). The AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  M4/GIRK expressing HEK293 cells were plated at 15,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 20mM HEPES. 384-well, black walled, clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated plates were used. After overnight incubation at 37degreesC in the presence of 5% CO2, the medium was removed and BTC-AM (Molecular Probes) dye in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)) was added. After 1hour, the dye was replaced with HBSS. Test compounds were prepared in thallium assay buffer (125mM sodium gluconate, 1mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8mM calcium gluconate, 5mM glucose, 12mM thallium sulfate, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.3). The compounds were added to the cell plate by the Hamamatsu FDSS. Each cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 10seconds, 10uL of test compound was added, and the cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 2minutes total sampling time. Each kinetic trace was normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity to correct for dye loading of the cells. The ratios were used to calculate the slope of the response after compound addition (time 15 to 24 seconds). Slope values used resulted from a linear fit with 30 iterations or with a chi squared value less than or equal to 0.0001. The slope for each test compound response was compared to the sample population treated as a Gaussian distribution. Compounds selected as 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = 100 had slope values that differed from the mean sample distribution at 99.7% confidence level.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions . Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have RV less than 100. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. An active compound for RGS7 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 25 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219362). Substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1135.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 6.8 (86 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, tribasic), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin B (0.065 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. Activity of single compounds identified from mixture HTS were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.13 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Pyruvate kinase (purified from Bacillus stearothermophilus) was assayed for its ability to generate pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) using ADP as a substrate. Pyruvate generation was detected in a coupled reaction by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-mediated NADH reduction resulting in an absorbance change at 340 nm. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for inhibitors and activators. In addition, ribose 5 phosphate, a positive modulator of pyruvate kinase, was included in the assay in order to identify possible activators. Firstly, 1 &#956;L of compound solution in DMSO was dissolved in 49 &#956;L of a solution containing all components except the pyruvate kinase substrate PEP. Of this mix, 4x7 &#956;L were transferred to the small volume measurement plate. After incubation for 15 minutes at 30#C, 7 &#956;L of PEP solution were added to each well and the plate was measured in a continuous kinetics mode for absorbance at 340 nm. Final assay concentrations were 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.2), 0.6 mM NADH, 0.4 mM ADP, 0.14 nM R5P, 50 mM potassium chloride, 7mM magnesium sulphate, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2 U LDH, 0.07 U pyruvate kinase, 0.05% BSA and 2 mM PEP.

Description:  DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones.  In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules.  Here, we propose to use unbiased NMR-based screening to identify some small molecules that bind to the DnaK substrate binding domain, which will be further developed into potentially chemical tools against DnaK. 1.Protein expression and purification The gene coding for the E. coli Dnak substrate binding domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein contains proteins with 17 extra amino acid residues (mgsshhhhhhglvprgs) at the N-termini. The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) plys S and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The uniformly 15N-lableled DnaK was produced by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal media containing 15NHCl as the sole nitrogen source. The NMR samples were dissolved in 20 uM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 90%/10% (H2O/D2O) or 99.5% D2O. 3. NMR Based Screening A. Ligand binding was monitored by comparing the aliphatic region of 1D 1H NMR spectra of a 20 uM DnaK (393-507) solution (20 uM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 90%/10% H2O/D2O or 99.5% D2O; T= 300 K) in the presence and in absence of compounds tested at a final concentration of 125 uM. Compounds were initially tested at mixtures of 10, and then individual compounds for those mixtures that caused significant perturbations in the spectrum (>0.08 ppm) were subsequently tested for an estimated Kd with a single titration point (3:1 ligand:protein molar ratio, protein at 30 uM concentration). Compounds with an estimated Kd values of < 500 uM are subsequently measured by a complete NMR titration. B. Hit compounds with estimated Kd values of 200 uM or less are selected for further SAR studies including Kd determination by ITC. Analogues are selected and purchased directly from commercial sources and tested for binding to the target. SAR data are further analyzed to design additional analogues to be chemically synthesized. 4.Binding Constant Determination by NMR Dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) of ligands were determined by monitoring the protein chemical shift changes as a function of ligand concentration. Kd of ligand is initially estimated with a single titration point according to the following equation: Kd=[To](1-p)([Lo]-[To]*p)/([To]*p) To and Lo are total concentration of target protein and ligand, respectively. The parameter p represents the fractional population of bound versus free species at equilibrium, which for fast exchanging ligands is measured as: p = (^obs - ^f)/(^sat - ^free) ^obs is the observed receptor chemical shift during the titration, and ^free and ^sat are the chemical shifts for the receptor in the unbound and fully bound (saturated) states, respectively. Hit compounds (those with the highest estimated binding affinity:in this case those with Kd values of 500 uM or better) are subsequently determined more accurately by a more complete NMR titration. At least six data points were collected for different concentration of ligand and Kd can then be determined by a non-linear least squares fit of p versus [Lo]. p = {([To]+[Lo]+Kd)- Sqr(([To]+[Lo] + Kd)**2 -4[Lo][To])}/2[To]

Description:  Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that currently affects over 200 million.  It is caused by different species of flatworms, such as Schistosoma mansoni.  Over the last century, drugs to treat the disease have evolved from potassium antimonyl tartrate, artemisinin, oxamniquine, to praziquantel, with praziquantel remaining the universally-used single drug of choice over the past three decades.  However, transmission rates have changed little with praziquantel, and there is evidence for the development of drug resistant parasites.  Because there is currently no suitable alternative therapy available, there is an urgent need to identify new targets and drugs for schistosomiasis treatment.  Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), one uniquely positioned S. mansoni enzyme, has been identified as a major component of the worms' distinct and compressed antioxidant "firewall".  TGR is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion between reduced and oxidized forms of both glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxins, thus making it an attractive new antiparasitic target. Recently, a quantitative high-throughput screen of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR, ~71K at the time of the screen in 2007) was performed using an assay that targeted both TGR and peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2, an H2O2-reducing enzymatic component of the S. mansoni redox "firewall") by following the decrease of NADPH fluorescence.  The screen led to the identification of furoxan (4-phenyl-3-furoxancarbonitrile, PubChem CID 1756) (oxadiazole-2-oxide class) that acted as a TGR inhibitor and later was shown to possess potent ex vivo worm killing ability at modest concentrations (10 uM) and against all developmental stages of worm. Additional mechanistic link between exogenous NO donation and parasitic injury for the oxadiazole-2-oxide class of compounds was also expanded and better defined.  Although the screen addressed both TGR and Prx2, the assay required post-screen target deconvolution for further characterization of the actives.  In addition, the fluorescence assay was also subject to fluorescence interference from compound library members.  We have developed a 1536-well-based kinetic HTS assay to address TGR alone.  The assay followed the reduction of 5, 5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Ellman's reagent) by NADPH and measured the increase in absorbance at 412 nm of the reaction product, TNB.  Furoxan inhibition that was observed in the screening assay was recapitulated in this miniaturized absorbance assay; furthermore, concentration-response curves of furoxan were almost identical upon separate testing, with IC50s falling within the 4.0-7.9 uM range.  This assay format can be used to screen the current MLSMR collection (with >300K compounds available) to find novel TGR inhibitors.  Furoxan is a good choice to serve as a positive control in the primary HTS assay. Three microliters of reagents (100 uM NADPH and 20 nM TGR or 100 uM NADPH as no-enzyme control) were dispensed into 1,536-well black clear-bottomed plates.  Compounds (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys pin tool equipped with 1536-pin array (10 nL slotted pins, V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA).  The plates were then be incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and 1 uL aliquot of 500 uM NADPH were added, immediately followed by a 1 uL aliquot of 15 mM DTNB to start the reaction.  The plate was transferred to a ViewLux high-throughput CCD imager (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) where kinetic measurements of the TNB absorbance were acquired using a 405 excitation filter. Throughout the screen, reagent bottles and all liquid lines were made light-tight to minimize reagent degradation.  All screening operations were performed on a fully integrated robotic system (Kalypsys, San Diego, CA) containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 anthropomorphic robotic arms (Staubli, Duncan, SC). Library plates were screened starting from the lowest and proceeding to the highest concentration, and a "double-dipping" step of the highest concentration was required to access higher concentrations of compounds.  Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column 5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in order to monitor for and record any shifts in the background, which can be affected by reagent dispensers or loss in enzyme activity overtime.  Screening data were corrected, normalized, and concentration-effect relationships will be derived by using publicly-available curve fitting algorithms developed in-house (http://ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts).  A four parameter Hill equation was fitted to the concentration-response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and observed responses.

Description:  Dose response biochemical assay for autofluorescent inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity This assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave a fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which was modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens. The fTHP is labeled with both a fluorophore (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) and a quencher 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in unquenching of the Mca fluorescence. In this assay, the fluorescence signal from liberated Mca fluorescence is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) in Assay Buffer containing 50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5 (all chemicals purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive or negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in Assay Buffer (same composition as above). Fluorescence (t0) was read after enzyme addition on a Perkin-Elmer Viewlux microplate reader (excitation = 325nm, emission = 450nm). After 4 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence (t4) was read again. The difference between RFU values read at t0 (RFU_t0) and t4 (RFU_t4), named delta RFU, was calculated as follows: delta RFU = RFU_t4 - RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (test_compound_delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)/( positive_control_ delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)*100 Where positive_control is defined as test wells containing 8 micromolar MMP13 inhibitor and negative_control is defined as test wells containing DMSO only. For each compound, percentage inhibitions were plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% inhibition level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 39.8 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 39.8 micromolar. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 of equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed.

Description:  Beta-glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. The inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase results in Gaucher disease, which is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bony lesions and bone marrow infiltration with characteristic storage cells, known as Gaucher cells. There are also forms of the disorder affecting the central nervous system. Patients with the same genotypes can manifest with diverse clinical presentations and it is believed that improper folding and trafficking of beta-glucocerbrosidase may contribute to the phenotypes observed. Low molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of misfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby enhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Using normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule inhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms. A pro-fluorescent substrate was chosen for a screen against a small molecule library. The beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The Km for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside was determined to be 71.2 uM. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, was determined to be 87.5 uM. All compounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s). To confirm activity from the original screen, samples were reacquired from MLSCN and also synthesized in-house, and re-screened against the original assay at a higher density of titration points. Both enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium taurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both assays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a final concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM. This particular assay protocol was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: Red fluorescence substrate assay: 2 uL enzyme 23 nL compound 1 uL substrate (final concentration of 30 uM) Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes Read the plate in Viewlux plate reader (Ex=548(7) and Em=600(10)).

Description:  The pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative disorders has been a disappointment when compared to the successes obtained in stroke, other neurological diseases like seizures, and in mental health diseases. It has to be said that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and their early diagnosis represent a definite obstacle to effective intervention. Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a key cellular signaling factor in the central nervous system. Although NF-kB signaling pathways have been extensively investigated in cancer and in immunological diseases, NF-kB role in the central nervous system physiology and pathology in non inflammatory disorders of the brain is still unclear. NF-kB has an important role as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis and at least in this capacity it represents an interesting target to pursue. Recent evidence has also pointed out that this signaling system is involved in the resilience of neurons and in their ability to survive disparate insults. Functional knock out models of NF-kB, achieved via over-expression of its natural repressor I-kB, have shown that neurons from these animals are more sensitive to insults including trauma, Beta-amyloid toxicity and excitotoxicity. Also a direct neuroprotective effect from both non apoptotic and apoptotic models of neurodegeneration has been attributed to direct or indirect activation of NF-kB signaling. In addition, to the direct neuroprotective effect NF-kB up-regulation could also be of value in improving learning and memory. In fact, NF-kB signaling has been shown to improve long term potentiation and long term depression, two models of learning at cellular level. This background is of great appeal because up regulation of NF-kB in neurons could be useful in attacking, at the same time, neuronal degeneration and deterioration of neuronal functions associated with loss of learning and memory as seen in Alzheimer's disease. To pursue this scope, we have set up a novel human cell-based assay to identify small molecules able to up-regulate NF-kB expression for high throughput screening. The cell line developed for this assay, which is used to identify pharmacological probes for the activation of NF-kB, was prepared as follows. The SH-5YSY human neuroblastoma cell line was doubly stably transfected with a reporter construct coding the human NF-kB promoter driving the expression of the firefly luciferase and a reporter coding the resistance to the antibiotic blasticidin. TNF-alpha was used as a positive control as it a potent enhancer of NF-kB expression.  Negative control wells were treated with vehicle only. Cell Culture:  SH-5YSY (ATCC) cells stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the human NF-kB promoter fused upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter and blasticidin resistance (clone C1) were subcultured every 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) high glucose (1X) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate + 10% FBS + 3 ug/mL of blasticidin, and incubated at 37C in 5% CO2, and maintained at a subconfluent density of no more than 240,000 cells/cm2 for less than 30 passages. Cell Culture Reagents used: 1. D-MEM high glucose (1X), liquid, with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, Invitrogen: 11995-065 2. Blasticidin S HCl Invitrogen: R210-01 Compound and Control Preparation: Prior to cell addition, control drugs were diluted in assay media and added to each 384 well plate at a final concentration of 5 ng/mL for TNF-alpha (positive control). DMSO concentration of 0.3% was maintained for all control wells. Test compounds were serially diluted in a plate-to-plate matrix or "stacked plate" dose response format.  All 320 compounds in a source plate were diluted together through the 10-plate matrix resulting in a 10-point dose response dilution series. It can be visualized as a serial dilution series proceeding vertically through a stack of plates with the high dose plate on top and the low dose plate on the bottom with the final compound concentration ranging from 0.0586 to 30 uM and a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% for all concentrations). Assay Conditions: 1. Add 5,000 cells/well in 20 uL with a Matrix WellMate 2. Centrifuge briefly at 1,000 RPM. 3. Incubate at RT for 30 min 4. Incubate at 37C, 5% CO2 for at least 20-26 h 5. Equilibrate Bright Glo (Promega, Inc) to room temp 6. Equilibrate assay plates to room temperature for 30 min. 7. Add 25 uL of Bright Glo into each well with a ThermoFisher MultiDrop 8.

Description:  OGT is the sole enzyme that mediates the attachment of O-GlcNAc groups to serine and threonine residues in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, and no specific inhibitors are known. This type of glycosylation is involved in signal transduction and plays a key role in many essential cellular processes. High O-GlcNAc levels have been correlated to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In addition to elucidating the role of O-GlcNAc in cellular processes, inhibitors of OGT might be useful in studying and perhaps treating type 2 diabetes. Since HTS-amenable direct assay for OGT activity is currently unavailable, a simpler substrate-displacement screen was performed. The signal measured is based on the change in fluorescence polarization of a fluorescein-labeled UDP-GlcNAc upon displacement from its complex with OGT. Recombinant truncated version of the enzyme, sOGT, as well as labeled probe, were made available by Suzanne Walker and Benjamin Gross, Harvard Medical School. 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.01% Tween-20, 500 uM THP (Tris (hydroxypropyl) phosphine). Reagents / Controls: 50 nM/1.5 uM sOGT /100 uM UDP in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (full inhibition of binding, 0 % activity). 50 nM probe/1.5 uM sOGT in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Titration of UDP control (from 40 mM, then 1:2) pin-transferred to column 2. Column 1 is neutral (100% activity). Three uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black plates. Compounds and controls (20 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then read on ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager using fluorescein polarization filter set and 45 seconds exposure time. During dispense, reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath and all liquid lines were covered with aluminum foil to minimize probe and protein degradation.

Description:  Many cellular pathways leading to activation of NF-kB-family transcription factors have been identified to be participating in host-defense, immunity, inflammation, and cancer. Recently, a unique pathway activated by antigen receptors on T- and B-Lymphocytes has been revealed, involving a cascade of participating proteins that includes CARMA1 (BIMP3), Bcl-10, paracaspase (MALT1), TRAF6, and Ubc13. This pathway is initiated by Protein Kinase C-theta, which induces phosphorylation of components of this signaling pathway. Based on experiments using siRNA and dominant-negative mutants, it has been determined that treatment of cells with the combination of phorbol ester PMA and the calcium-ionophore Ionomycin triggers this pathway, resulting in NF-kB activation. Compounds able to block this stimulation will be useful research tools for analysis of the physiological roles of this NF-kB activation pathway. This assay utilizes HEK-293 cells that have been stably transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid pUC13-4xNFkB-Luc, allowing the expression of the firefly luciferase under the control of four tandem HIV NFkB response elements. As previously described, stimulation with a PMA/Ionomycin mix results in NF-kB activation, thus increasing luciferase expression and luminescence levels measured with an appropriate substrate. Compounds that decrease light emission are potential inhibitors and may be able to block the NF-kB activation triggered by the PMA/Ionomycin stimulation, hence providing valuable tools to decipher this new pathway. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 3 micromolar final concentration. HEK-293 stably transfected with the pUC13-4xNFkB-Luc were cultured in T-175 flasks (Corning part#431080) at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 11965-092) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen part#ant-pr-1). Prior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 625,000 cells per milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 21063-029) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen part#ant-pr-1). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well (i.e. 2,500 cells/well) of a white solid-bottom 1536-well plate (Kalypsys part# K1536 SWST) Plates were then placed in the incubator overnight at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity. Twenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with 15 nL/well of compounds (3 micromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.30%). One hour later, cells were stimulated with 1 microliter per well of a PBS mix of PMA (100ng/mL, Calbiochem part#524400) and Ionomycin (50ng/mL, Calbiochem part#407950). Plates were subsequently returned to the incubator for 16 hours (37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity). After the incubation, plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 20 minutes. A luciferase assay was performed by adding 5 microliters per well of the SteadyLite HTS reagent (Perkin Elmer part#6016989). After a 15 minutes incubation time, light emission was measured (30s per plate) with the ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen, cat# PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates. In the assay, the ADP levels were detected using Promega ADP-Glo technology wherein the remaining ATP from the kinase reaction is first depleted with an ATPase reagent followed by a reagent that contains and enzyme which converts the ADP produced to ATP as well as Ultra-Glo luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the ATP. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 300801-52-9) which has been described as an inhibitor of Clk 4[1]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 1x ADP-Glo Buffer A, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentrations) was dispensed into 1536-well plates (Greiner, solid white, medium binding assay plates) with the Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Twenty-three nanoliter of compound and control solutions were transferred to the assay plate  using a Kalypsys pin-tool followed by 0.5 uL/well Clk4-buffer solution (25 nM Clk4, 1x ADP-Glo Buffer A, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) dispensing for a total kinase reaction volume of 2.5 uL/ well. After 1 hr of room-temperature incubation, 2.5 uL ADP-Glo reagent was added and incubated at room temperature for 45 min to stop the kinetic reaction and degrade residual ATP. The ADP product was then converted to ATP by adding 5 uL per well of ADP-Glo Reagent II to yield a total assay volume of 10 uL/ well. Luminescence was detected after 30 min room temperature incubation with the Perkin Elmer Viewlux.

Description:  The cytochrome P450 enzymes represent a diverse superfamily of hemoproteins present in eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaean systems. The primary function of these enzymes is in the metabolism and clearance of both endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds due to their propensity to metabolize multiple substrates through the catalysis of a range of reactions. CYP2C19 is an important enzyme in this superfamily in its ability to metabolize several important groups of drugs including antiepileptics and many proton-pump inhibitors. In the assay, we tested the ability of compounds from MLSMR compound collection to stimulate the 2C19-catalyzed conversion of the substrate luciferin-H EGE to luciferin EGE detected using luciferase reaction. Materials: 1) human 2C19 enzyme (BD Biosciences, cat #456259) 2) Substrate - Luciferin-H EGE (Promega) 3) Luciferin detection reagent containing luciferase/ATP (Promega) 4) Components of NADPH regeneration system were from Sigma-Aldrich. 5) Negative control wells contained 2.5 mM tranylcypromine 6) Positive control wells contained vehicle solution CYP2C19 HTS protocol: Assay was performed in 4-uL volume using 1536-well white plates (Greiner, 782075). Reaction was initiated by addition of solution of enzyme and luciferin substrate to the whole plate already containing compounds and NADPH regenerating system. Final concentrations of components in the assay were as follows: 1) 10 uM Luciferin-H EGE 2) 32 nM 2C19 enzyme 3) 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate 4) 3.3 mM magnesium chloride 5) 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 6) 0.4 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 7) 5 uM compounds (columns 5-48) 8) Columns 1-2 contained positive control samples 9) Columns 3-4 contained no compounds Reaction was terminated after 30 min at room temperature by addition of 3 uL of reconstituted luciferin detection reagent. The plates were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Luminescent signal was measured on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  This project aims to identify small drug-like molecules that activate (agonists) the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) or enhance its TRH-stimulated activity (allosteric enhancers). TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders. Upon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. A cytosolic calcium indicator exhibits increased fluorescence in the presence of calcium release. This validation screen measures compound-induced activation of calcium release. For the HTS assay freshly prepared cells are plated at a density of 2000/well in 3 ul of complete DMEM medium containing 10% serum in 1536-well plates and cultured over night at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The next day, 2 ul of a no wash calcium dye (ABD Bioquest) was added to the cells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For the assay, assay plates were loaded into the FDSS kinetic plate reader.  A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as TRH controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Signaling through the dopamine D5 receptor is coupled to the CRE/luciferase reporter system in HEK 293 cells. Compounds at 10 micromolar final concentration were tested in duplicate for their ability to modulate the D5 receptor in the presence of dopamine stimulation. The signal readout from this assay is luciferase luminescence as measured by the Perkin Elmer Envision. Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEKs) containing human D5 receptor were seeded at 35000 cells/well in Greiner black, solid bottom poly-lysine coated 384-well plates (Cat#781947) in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 5% Fetalclone I serum (Hyclone), 5% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 0.05 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). After incubation, the cell plates were cooled to room temperature for 15 minutes and 20 microliters of SteadyLite Luciferase Reagent (Perkin Elmer #6016989) was added.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-L)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-L and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. EGFR and EGFR mutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

Description:  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the larger herpesvirus family that consists of three subfamilies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an extremely prevalent human herpesvirus. Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that EBV infects, which are primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. Infection of both cell types is associated with a variety of proliferative disorders and cancers. Current treatments for such malignancies are traditional chemotherapy, radiation-therapy, surgery, and if possible, restoration of immune system function. Like all herpesviruses, EBV has mechanisms to evade the immune system and maintain latency in the human host. A treatment directed specifically against EBV could significantly improve patient care by limiting initial acute infection and spread of the virus between cells. Currently there are no inhibitors that block the entry of EBV. EBV gH and gL proteins form a heterodimeric complex and are required for membrane fusion with all known EBV-targeted cell types. gp42 is an EBV-encoded protein and is essential for EBV infection of B cells. In EBV, gH/gL forms a high affinity complex with gp42 prior to MHC class II binding and the activation of membrane fusion. In B cell fusion, gp42 binding to gH/gL is required for fusion activation. The central role of the EBV gH/gL protein in viral entry into both B cells and epithelial cells makes it an attractive target for the development of anti-viral inhibitors. To discover novel small molecule inhibitors of EBV induced membrane fusion and entry, which act by blocking essential viral protein interactions, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP) based assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction between the gH/gL protein with a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from gp42 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step mix-and-measure method was achieved for analyzing gH/gL protein and gp42 interaction. gH/gL protein FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 1536-well uHTS format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z&#8242; factor of above 0.7. Because of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for ultra high-throughput screening in 1536 well format of small molecules that bind directly to EBV gH/gL and block EBV entry. 1.Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2.gH/gL protein 3.gp42-36-81 peptide with an N-terminal fluorescein label (gp42-Flu) Procedure: 1.   Make assay reaction buffer for uHTS that contains gH/gL protein (2 nM, final concentration), gp42-Flu peptide (2 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 4.5 uL of assay reaction buffer to 1536-well black assay plate. 3. Add 100 nL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. Final concentration of each compound is 21.74 uM. 4. Record FP signals with an Envision Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. 1.FP signals are expressed as mP and recorded by Envision Multilabel plate reader. 2.Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FPcompound - FPpeptide only) / (FPcontrol -FPpeptide only)) * 100 Where FPcompound is the FP value from a well with a test compound, FPpeptide only is an average FP value from wells with gp42-Flu peptide only; FP value control is an average FP values from wells containing gH/gL protein and gp42-Flu peptide, which defines maximal FP signal. 3. Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME: Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE:  The percent inhibitions are rounded to 0 decimal places.  Pct Inhibitions > 100 are rounded to 100, and those < 0 are rounded to 0.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected using a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). To validate the specific action of compounds on the NPS receptor, a counterscreen was developed that tests compounds' antagonism of M1 muscarinic receptor stimulation by carbachol. The protein, gene and taxonomy linked to this assay refer to Rattus norvegicus, but Chinese Hamster ovary cells were actually used. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in 1536-well format. The maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted into text files using the instrument's software data export utility. Data for antagonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. CHO-M1 1536-well FDSS assay protocol: (1) Frozen CHO-M1 cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The calcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. (3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (4) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (5) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000. (6) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. (7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM carbachol). Record antagonist response (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 180 s.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. 1) OPRK1 beta-Arrestin (DiscoveRx) 2) Assay Medium: Opti-MEM Medium supplemented with 1% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) 3) Growth Medium: MEM supplemented with 10% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) Day 1 1) Harvest cells using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen Cat#13151-14).

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  The activity of MK was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of absorbance (OD340) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for MK inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited MK and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of MK. Mevalonate Kinase Protocol for 384-well HTS Final Assay Conditions in 26 uL total volume: 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 6 mM MgCl2 5 mM ATP 0.2 mM Mevalonate 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.4 mM NADH 3 units/ml rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 3 units/ml rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase 60 nM Mevalonate Kinase (MK) 4% DMSO Background conditions are the same as above except that the substrate (mevalonate) is left out.  The assay was run in 384-well clear non-binding plates. Fifteen uL substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 uL volumes using the FX. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL of MK using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the MK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing MK with hexokinase.

Description:  Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule antagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the chemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a role at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells, and dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a recent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal liver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in primary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the metastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation of the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases including hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as 'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important objective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer metastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. In this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. The goal of this assay is to validate hits obtained in "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 493098 and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. A.

Description:  The thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling pathway was assayed in murine Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with the human TPO receptor and a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the Glycoprotein IIb promoter (provided by Axxam). BaF3 cells are an IL-3-dependent pro B cell line that upon TPO stimulation, undergo cell division and induce the megakaryocyte marker, Glycoprotein IIb. The assay was screened at the EC50 of TPO (26 pM) to identify activators of the pathway. Cells were maintained at 37 C and 5% CO2in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/mL murine IL-3, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Prior to plating, cells were incubated overnight in medium without IL-3. Cells were plated at 250 cells/5uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates, 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool, and 1 uL of TPO (26 pM final concentration in IL-3 deficient medium) was added. Following 24 hrs of incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 4 uL of Steadylite detector mix (PerkinElmer) was added, the plates incubated at room temperature for 10 min and luminescence was measured for 10 s and 2X binning by a ViewLux detector (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-011) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied RNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific regulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard genetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality. This screen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins required for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First, inhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding proteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function across nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent that specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.  The two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class tandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the germline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates posterior patterning and germline specification. Both proteins can be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro. Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate reader.  Expected Outcome: The ability of purified POS-1 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to screen for inhibitors of this interaction.  Compounds inhibiting the interaction with show a dose-dependent reduction in the polarization value (in mP.)  This is a counterscreen because compounds that inhibit the interaction of POS-1 protein with Mex-3 RNA in addition to the desired MEX-5-tcr2 disruption are not of interest for further development, as they are likely non-specific inhibitors of zinc finger protein-RNA binding or general protein disruptors such as detergents.  7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844) in duplicate assay plates.  Predispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to two weeks.  For higher doses, 15 or 30 nL was predispensed. POS-1 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was prepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master mix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004% IPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser (Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  The target binding sequence is a 3'-UTR fragment, mex3.  Fluorescent mex3 RNA (5'-AACUAUUAUUAUUUGUUAUUCAUAUUUU-FITC-3', IDT) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma). The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees for 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at room temperature. The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light. Competing unlabeled mex3 RNA (IDT) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25 uM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature. 1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr). The assay plates with predispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on the Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either 1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well of competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells). The final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were: 20 mM tris pH 8.0 40 mM NaCl 0.004% IPEGAL 100 uM zinc acetate 120 nM POS1 protein 2 nM FITC labeled mex3 RNA 4 ug/mL tRNA type X 10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO For positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled mex3 RNA Plates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute. One hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer) with a G factor of 1.  Total fluorescence from the P and S polarization channels was recorded along with the Fluorescence Polarization calculation.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET (time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer and the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating a TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The native unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding and reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled molecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be detected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was successfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200 cells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 uM RO-201724 (Sigma-Aldrich, B8279), 1.5% Alexa 647-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (from Perkin Elmer), 100 nM NPS) (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well detection reagent. Detection reagent was prepared by adding biotin labeled cAMP (4%), streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (1.33%) and TritonX-100 (1%) to detection buffer. Biotin labeled cAMP, streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate and detection buffer all came from the LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Cultured human H69AR lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds from a 10,000 compound subset of the NIH Small Molecule Repository for 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 micromolar. Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminesence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control. Percent cell viability values were calculated based on two separate experiments.

Description:  The purpose of this screen was to test confirmed primary hits from the M1 Antagonist Screen for their ability to elicit a response at the mGluR4 receptor under assay conditions similar to the primary screen. 1.  Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing mGluR4 receptor were plated at 30,000 cells/well in assay media (DMEM, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 20mM HEPES) in 384 well plates. 2.  The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3.  Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 millimolar HEPES, 2.5 millimolar Probenecid, pH 7.4)  containing 4.0 micromolar Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4.  Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5.  Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nanometer excitation and 540 nanometer emission filters 6.  10 micromolar test compound in assay buffer + 0.1 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7.  Subsequently, 10 micromolar glutame (EC80) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8.  0.1% DMSO, compound vehicle, and 200 micromolar (ECMAX) were added to each plate as controls. 1.  Minimum and maximum fluorescence intensities were selected from the time window ranging from 196 seconds to 250 seconds. 2.  The minimum fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the maximum fluorescence intensity to give 'Value'. 3.  Compounds selected with 'Score' of '100' and 'Outcome' of 'Active' had 'Value' less than the mean of EC80 minus three standard deviations. 6.  All calculations were done on a per plate basis using Pipeline Pilot with the R statistics package.

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. The FPRL1 dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPR binding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and specificity of compounds identified to have FPRL1 binding activity in the FPRL1 dose-response assay report. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. Ki determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in the dose response assay. Test compounds with Ki less than 10 microM were scored as active and all others as inactive.

Description:  Addiction leading to abuse should  be treatable by pharmacological approaches, and programs that identify new drugs to treat methamphetamine abuse address an immediate goal of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that new approaches are needed for treating METH addiction. Currently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the psychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity, psychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not lead to the development of tolerance [2]. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin receptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses. We propose to identify novel small molecule neurotensin receptor agonists by screening libraries of compounds using a primary assay based upon the ability of a b-arrestin fluorescent reporter to directly recognize the activated state of the NTR1. A. Brief Description of the Assay: This assay is to perform a 10 pt. dose-response on confirmed  lead agonists that activate the Neurotensin receptor-1 (NTR1) pathway by detecting spots from beta-arrestin GFP in NTR1-U2OS Osteosarcoma Cells.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of Wee1 degradation. The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a kinase negative mutant of Wee1 (Wee1K328M) fused to a luciferase reporter gene. As designed, compounds that increase Wee1K328M-luciferase stability and/or prevent its degradation will lead to increased well luminescence compared to untreated wells. Specifically, compounds that increase luminescence are considered Wee1 degradation inhibitors. HeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture (PSN) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). HeLa cells were transiently transfected in T75 flasks by mixing 6 million cells with 29 micrograms of the Luc::Wee1K328M plasmid complexed with 87 microliters of TransIT-LT1 reagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per mL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at -80 degrees C until needed. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compound (final nominal 5 uM concentration) to sample wells, DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) to Low Control wells, or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to High Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-021) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.

Description:  Cultured human H69AR lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds from the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository for 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 micromolar in the absence or presence of doxorubicin at a concentration of 2 micromolar. Following treatment, the level of ATP, which is indicative of viable cell number, was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence.  Each plate contained 24 replicates of carrier treated cells which served as a negative control, 16 replicates for 25 micromolar sulindac sulfide which served as a positive control for reversing resistance to doxorubicin, and 24 replicates for 6-methyl purine riboside (1 micrograms/ml), which served as a positive control for cytotoxicity.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell culture, plating, and dye loading. HEK/GIRK cells stably expressing the M4 muscarinic receptor were grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12, 10 percent fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 700 ug/ml G418. The rat mGluR4 cell line was prepared by PCR amplification of the entire coding sequence of each receptor and cloning into pIRES puro 3 (Invitrogen). Cloning sites were BamHI/Not I. HEK/GIRK/M4 cells were transfected with 24 ug of DNA and stable transfectants were selected with puromycin. And a monoclonal cell lines was established. Cells were grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12, 10percent fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine (Growth Media). mGluR/GIRK lines were supplemented with 600 ng/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 700 ug/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells for experiments were generally maintained for approximately 15-20 passages; this was particularly important for experiments examining the endogenous alpha2C receptor. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Cells were plated into 384 well, black-walled, clear-bottom poly-D-lysine coated plates (Greiner) at a density of 15,000 cells/20 uL/well in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Assay Media). Plated cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 percent CO2. The following day, the medium was removed from the cells and 20 uL/well of 1.7 uM concentration of the indicator dye BTC-AM (Invitrogen; prepared as a stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pluronic acid F-127) in Assay Buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen) containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3) was added to the plated cells. Cells were incubated for one hour at room temperature and the dye was replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compound preparation. Glutamate was diluted in Thallium Buffer (125 mM sodium bicarbonate (added fresh the morning of the experiment), 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8 mM calcium sulfate, 5 mM glucose, 12 mM thallium sulfate, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) at 5x the final concentration to be assayed. For fold shift experiments, compounds were diluted to a 60 uM (2x final) concentration in Assay Buffer. Cell plates and compound plates were loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Appropriate baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm emission, 540+/-30 nm) and test compounds were added. Compounds were added in a 20 uL volume and incubated for approximately 2.5 minutes prior to the addition of 10 ul of Thallium Buffer +/- agonist. After the addition of agonist, data were collected for an additional 2 min. Thallium sulfate requires special handling and disposal precautions and investigators are cautioned to contact their Environmental Health and Safety Department to ensure proper procedures are followed. Data analysis. Data were analyzed using usoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Description:     To identify novel compounds that can act as estrogenic activators, a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384-well format.  This assay monitors the potentiation of the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium. The interaction of ER-alpha with SRC1 under a low estradiol concentration brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, generating basal level of FRET. Compounds that can further enhance the interaction with increased FRET signal are identified as positives for further analysis. These compounds could either be conventional ligand agonists or potentiators of coactivator-ER-alpha binding that operate by a mechanism distinct from binding as agonists in the ligand binding pocket. Distinction between these two mechanisms requires various counter-screening assays. 1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17beta-Estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17beta-estradiol (0.5 nM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add 0.5 uL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. Final concentration of each compound in each well is 25.6 uM. 4. Record FRET signal with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 620 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of activity = (FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol - FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRETcontrol is an average FRET ratio from wells containing ERalpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide that defines minimal FRET. 3. Compounds that cause > 300% activity are defined as positives.

Description:  Human alpha-thrombin was purchased from Haematologic Technologies Inc. (Cat no. HCT-0020). Substrate Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat no. I-1120.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. 1536-well black plates were from Corning (Item no. 3728). alpha-thrombin (5.5 ng/mL) was incubated with Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 5 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 30 min at room temperature. Hits from 1536 HTS were confirmed on single compounds by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using 2 transfers of 100 nL with the Evolution 1536 pintool (washed with isopropanol after each transfer) 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (11 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  The CHO-M1 (CHO-M1) cell line transfected with the rat acetylcholine muscarinic M1 receptor was obtained from ATCC. The cells were maintained in call culture flasks with F12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) at 37C, 5 % CO2  in a humidified atmosphere. At 90-95 % confluence, the cells were then detached in 15 ml 0.25 % trypsin by 3 minutes incubation at 37C and centrifuged at 1000 RPM to remove the trypsin solution. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in the cell freezing media containing 10 % DMSO (Invitrogen) at a density of 4 x 107 cells/ml. The aliquots of cells at 0.5 - 1 ml per vial were frozen down slowly at 1 degree C/min using a Cryo 1 degree C freezing container in the presence of isopropanol (Nalgene Nunc, Rochster, NY) overnight in a -80C freezer. The frozen cells were then transferred to liquid nitrogen for the storage up to one year. The resuspended frozen cells were plated at 3 ul/well with 2000 cells in the black, tissue culture treated, clear bottom 1536-well plates. After overnight incubation at 37C, 5% CO2, 2.5 ul/well no-wash calcium dye (containing Fluo-4, BD Biosciences) were loaded and incubated at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 1 hour followed by a 10 min incubation with 20 nl compound in DMSO solution. The assay plates were then placed onto the kinetic fluorescence plate reader (FDSS-7000, Hamamatsu) for a measurement of the kinetic changes in intracellular free calcium. The basal fluorescence signal was measured for 6 times at 1 Hz followed by an addition of 1 ul of carbachol and continued 4 min measurement. The results were calculated as the maximal signal (peak) divided by the minimal signal (basal). 1536-well assay protocol: (1) 3 ul/well containing 2000 M1-CHO cells in 1536 tissue culture treated black/clear bottom plate (2) Incubate 14 -20 hours at 37C with 5% CO2 (3) Add 1ul/well calcium dye (from no-wash calcium dye kit, BD Biosciences) containing mM Probenecid (4) Incubate 1 hour at 37C with 5% CO2 (5) Add 20 nl compound diluted in DMSO (6) Incubate 10 minutes at the room temp (7) Place the plate in FDSS-7000 instrument (Ex = 480 nm and Ex = 535 nm) #- read the assay plate 6 times at 1 Hz for basal signal #- add 1 ul/well EC80 carbachol (100 nM final) #- continuously read the assay plate for 4 min at 1 Hz

Description:  b-galactosidase (b-gal), a hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of b-galactosides to monosaccharides is utilized in many different screening technologies involving enzyme reaction coupling and reporter assays, for example DiscoverX  b-Arrestin GPCR  assays such as the KOR1 Agonist or Antagonist.  This assay was developed and performed as a counterscreen for screening assays that utilize b-gal and a reaction that it catalyzes. By detecting inhibitors and activators of this enzyme, it is possible to attribute activity not to the primary assay in question, but rather to interaction with the method of detection. Assay materials: 1) Beta-Galactosidase from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat# G4155) 2) Assay Medium: Opti-MEM Medium supplemented with 1% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) 3) DiscoverX b-Arrestin Detection Reagents: Galacton Star, Emerald II, and Cell Assay Buffer Dose Response protocol: 1) Add 5.0 uL of b-gal diluted in assay media to 0.03 U/mL to all wells (0.02 U/mL final assay concentration) of a 1536-well plate with the exception of the positive control wells where 5.0 uL of assay media alone is added. 2) Spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 3) Prepare Detection Reagent Solution from DiscoveRx (1 part Galacton Star: 5 parts Emerald II and 19 parts Cell Assay Buffer). 4) Using a Labcyte Echo, DMSO and test compounds are transferred to assay wells. DMSO only is transferred to positive and negative control wells, while varying volumes of test compounds are transferred to test compound wells to achieve the desired test concentrations. Test compound wells in the assay plate are back-filled with DMSO to equalize final assay concentrations. 5) Spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 6) Add 2.5 uL of Detection Reagent Solution to all wells of assay plate and immediately spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 7) After 15 minutes, read assay plates on a Perkin Elmer Envision using a luminescence protocol

Description:  Chronic pain (neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, cancer pain) is a major health problem. Opiate-based drugs, such as morphine and morphine derivatives, are the primary standard of care for the treatment of chronic pain.  Unfortunately, patients develop tolerance to opiates due to desensitization of the opiate receptor.  Thus, alternative anti-nociceptive ("pain killing") pathways need to be explored for treatment of chronic pain. The N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV2.2s) in dorsal root ganglia neurons is a well validated target for chronic pain (1, 2). We previously demonstrated the interaction between CaV2.2 and the first PDZ domain of molecular adaptor protein Mint1 (3). In additional experiments we demonstrated that carboxyl-terminal association of CaV2.2 protein with the Mint1-PDZ domain plays an important role in synaptic targeting and function of N-type Ca2+ channels (4). The following describes a homogeneous terbium time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF) HTS assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of association between Mint1-PDZ domains and carboxyl-terminal peptide present in the long C-terminal splice variant of CaV2.2 pore-forming subunit of N-type calcium channels (NC peptide).  Compounds that disrupt the interaction would result in decrease of TR-FRET ratio and are detected in the assay. The C-terminal sequence in rat and human CaV2.2 sequences are highly conserved.  Small molecules identified in the screening would serve as useful probes for studies of synaptic function of N-type Ca2+ channels, its validation as a therapeutic target and/or as starting point for development of anti-nociceptive therapeutic agents with novel mechanism of action.  This assay was used as an alternate secondary screen to uHTS Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (HTRF) Assay AID 2073. Terbium HTRF in dose response Assay materials: 1) Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein (GST-M15) from assay provider. 2) Fluorescein labelled N-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl-terminal peptide (fluorescein-NC peptide) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of CaV2.2 protein (Bio Peptide lot# 0610096426) 3) Anti-GST monoclonal antibody labeled with terbium Tb-anti-GST antibody (Invitrogen cat# PV3551). 4) Tween-20 (Sigma cat#9416) 5) Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma cat# A7888) Working solutions: 1. Assay buffer: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100mM NaCl,0.1% BSA, 0.005% Tween-20 2. Mint1-PDZ working solution (2X final concentration) contains 10 nM GST-MINT-PDZ and 20 nM Tb-anti-GST 3. Fluorescein-NC peptide- (2X final concentration) contained 0.5 nM fluorescein-NC peptide. 4. Unlabelled  NC peptide-(2X final concentration) contained 0.5 nM unlabelled-NC peptide. Dose Response assay 1) Make Mint1 PDZ working solution.  Let sit 60 minutes at room temperature 2) Serial compound dilutions: dispense 70nL compounds in serial dilution using Labcyte Echo 550 to 1536 well white plates (Corning #3725) 3) Dispense 4 uL Mint1-PDZ working solution to each well 1536 well white plates (Corning #3725) 4) Incubate for 30 mins 5) Dispense 4 uL unlabelled NC peptide working solution to columns 1 & 2 6) ispense 4 uL of fluorescein-NC peptide working solution to columns 3-48 7) Seal plate.

Description:  As with the primary HTS assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human 5HT1a receptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-15 promiscuous coupling protein was used (Invitrogen, part K1083). Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 3 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 50ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.5 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 2% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate. Immediately after this step, 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added to the appropriate wells. The selective 5HT1A agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was also added (43 nL) to positive control wells to a final concentration of 1.25 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm. The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation= ((test_compound - median_negative_control)/(median_positive_control - median_negative_control))*100 The negative control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the positive controls wells were treated with the EC100 of 5-CT. For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (~50 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound potentiation of an EC20 dopamine response by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Apart of being a prototypical NF-kappaB target gene, recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 secretion (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007). The assay described below uses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a canonical NF-kB inducer, and is designed for identification of hits specific to TNFa-modulated pathways. We utilized this assay to assess selectivity of hits emerging from  the  NOD1- specific assay, "SAR analysis of GM-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD1 cells" (AID 2250) and NOD2- specific assay, "SAR analysis of Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD2 cells"(AID 2260) using IL-8. Protocol:  1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1 2. TNF-alpha (Sigma) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. TNF-alpha was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ng/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h.

Description:  Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of CRE-BLA A cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure nonspecific antagonism of the cAMP signaling pathway. Under normal conditions, the CRE promoter has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. In this assay, cells have been stimulated with forskolin, which stimulates adenylate cyclase, hence increasing BLA gene transcription.  An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by exogenously added forskolin. Therefore, in the presence of a potential cyclic AMP pathway antagonist, transcription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 61 available of 64 compounds that had greater than 50 percent inhibition and passed hit selection criteria from a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)" (PubChem AID = 736). For this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct was used. Dose response curves were also determined for  a set of 22 purchased compounds structurally similar to the hit compound identified in a previous set of experiments entitled, #Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)" (PubChem AID = 736),  #Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor# (PubChem AID = 851) and #Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of CRE-BLA# (PubChem AID =856, this assay) Cells were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL geneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. Prior to assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in phenol red free DMEM as above, except without antibiotics and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum.   Prior to the start of the assay, 10 ul of cell suspension (100,000 cells/well) were dispensed into each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2, 95 percent RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound in DMSO or DMSO (all control wells) to sample or control wells, respectively.  Immediately following this dispense, 1 ul of forskolin in PBS (final nominal forskolin concentration 2 uM, EC80) to compound wells and negative control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed to positive control wells.  Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol including 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio (I460nm/I590nm) where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers as follows: Percent Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/ (median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 Where: Test_compound is defined as wells containing test compound and forskolin Positive control is defined as wells containing PBS Negative control is defined as wells containing forskolin alone For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (39 uM) did not result in > 50 percent inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent inhibition is observed. This calculation resulted in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Agonists of the S1P2 Receptor of Purchased Analogues A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity.  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul(100, 000 cells/well) of cell suspension was dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to sample or control wells, respectively.  Next, 1.1 ul of S1P in 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 1 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm.  Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: Percent Activation = 100 *(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells) Where: Test compound well is defined as wells containing compound from the MLSCN library compound library Well ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength. Negative control is defined as well containing 2 percent fatty acid free BSA Positive control is defined as well containing 1 uM S1P Each compound was assayed in triplicate using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 42 uM.  For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (29.9 uM) did not result in > 50 percent activation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent activation is observed. This algorithm results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  To measure 5-HT1E activity, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was developed at the Scripps Molecular Research Institute Screening center. This line contained the human 5-HT1E receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15), and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. When cells were agonized with a 5HT1E agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The assay was conducted in 384-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 5-HT at a concentration equal to its EC90. The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The HTS assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added. The selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 was also added to negative control and test compound wells to a final concentration of 3 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 90% activity.  Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs.   After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm. The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/(median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 The positive control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the negative control and test compound wells were treated with the EC80 of S1P. For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (38.3 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This result in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)" (AID 1800) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)" (AID 1943). In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide molecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5' fluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to a second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon strand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon strand forms an intramolecular hairpin that brings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules into juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity at 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin formation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and quencher, thus preventing quenching of well fluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also performed to identify compounds that quench and enhance Cy5 fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM Tween20, 6 micrograms/mL BSA) containing 13.89 nM NS3 helicase fragment and 5.56 nM NS3 substrate were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, thioflavine S (110 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of 5 mM ATP into all wells. Well fluorescence was read after 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to inhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60 (RFU_t60), named Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows: Ratio_RFU = RFU_t60/RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by  solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 109 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-82, for inactive 79-0.

Description:  The transcriptional cell-based assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor RORA (encoded by the pFA-hRORA plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hRORA and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated RORA nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential inhibitors of the RORA nuclear receptor. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET (time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer and the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating a TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The native unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding and reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled molecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be detected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was successfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format. Select compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency, efficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs of active compounds from the primary screen. This particular assay uses a high density of sampling across concentration-response space to establish more confidence estimates of potency. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200 cells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 uM RO-201724 (Sigma-Aldrich, B8279), 1.5% Alexa 647-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (from Perkin Elmer), 100 nM NPS) (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well detection reagent. Detection reagent was prepared by adding biotin labeled cAMP (4%), streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (1.33%) and TritonX-100 (1%) to detection buffer. Biotin labeled cAMP, streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate and detection buffer all came from the LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/20 ul well 1 day prior to assay in Assay Media (DMEM with 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo-4 AM dye (1 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 2.5mM probenecid) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for 45 min to one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells. 6. 20 ul of assay buffer is added and removed. 20 ul of assay buffer is added. 8. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 9. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The max fluorescence increase beginning after the agonist addition was calculated.  Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was not active as a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'. Furthermore, the 3-fold decrease in glutamate EC50 in the presence of compound would suggest antagonistic modulation.

Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected using a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). To validate the specific action of compounds on the NPS receptor, a counterscreen was developed that tests compounds' antagonism of AVPR1B vasopressin receptor stimulation by vasopressin. Vasopressin shares 27% identity with the NPS receptor. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human vasopressin receptor (AVPR1B) was maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in 1536-well format. The maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted into text files using the instrument's software data export utility. Data for antagonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (no signal). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. CHO-V1B 1536-well FDSS assay protocol: (1) Frozen CHO-V1B cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The calcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. (3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (4) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (5) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000. (6) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. (7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM vasopressin). Record antagonist response (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 180 s.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. The purpose of this assay was to test the lead compounds for dose-dependency at rM4/Gqi5 using a calcium uptake assay. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degreesC. Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compounds that showed dose-response activity were assigned as 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100'.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 7 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 7 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  Enterococcus faecalis HMGR converts mevalonate and coenzyme A to HMG-CoA using NADP as a cofactor.  A product of this reaction, NADPH, absorbs strongly at 340 nm.  The rate of the reaction is measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm with a PerkinElmer Envision microplate reader.  This assay was chosen rather than the HMG-CoA reductase reaction because the substrates, mevalonate and coenzyme A, are less expensive and more stable than HMG-CoA.  NADP is also more stable than NADPH, making this a more robust assay for use in a HTS format.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The purpose of this assay was to screen for compounds that would reduce the observed assay rate, which would in theory be the result of the compound inhibiting the activity of the target enzyme, HMGR. A total of 197,000 compounds were screened at a final concentration of 10 uM.  For follow-up testing, the 320 most potent inhibitors and the 320 most potent activators were tested in a dose response assay at concentrations ranging from 100-0.2 uM.  HMG-CoA Reductase Protocol for 384-well HTS. Compound Dosing/Plating: For the dose response screen, a 1:2 serial dilution in DMSO was made from the source plate, and 1 ul of compound was dispensed into assay plates, resulting in a final concentration range of 100-0.2 uM. Assay Setup: Fifteen uL of HMG-CoA reductase reagent mix which included coenzyme A, NADP, and mevalonate in assay buffer was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 384-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 10 uL of HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 2 mM coenzyme A, 4 mM NADP, 4 mM mevalonate, and 15 ug/ml HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM KCl, 2% DMSO and 0.01% Tween 20). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 160 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns with 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the mevalonate had been left out (background). For the dose response screen, the assay was carried out as described above with compound concentrations ranging from 100-0.2 uM.

Description:  Modification of proteins by SUMO is a dynamic and reversible process. SUMOylation/deSUMOylation cycle regulates SUMOs function. Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) are involved in both the maturation of SUMO precursors (endopeptidase cleavage) and deconjugation of the targets (isopeptidase cleavage). There are seven SENPs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) in humans, and several of these have been characterized as SUMO (or Nedd8) specific enzymes. The objective of this project is to generate small molecule inhibitors specific for SENP6 (the deSUMOylating enzyme).  1536-well chemiluminescent screening assay utilizes RLRGG-aminoluciferin peptide substrate and is based on SENP6-dependent deconjugation of the aminoluciferin, which serves as a substrate for the coupled luciferase.  This screening assay was developed and performed at the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN). 1) Z-RLRGG-aminoluciferin (Promega #X554X) 2) Luciferin Detection Reagent (LDR) Promega #V859B dissolved in 75mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 10mM MgSO4. 3) Catalytic domain of human SENP6 (aa 628-1112) - provided by Dr. Salvesen's laboratory. 4) Assay Buffer (75mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 4mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) 5) Corning 1536-well white microtiter plates (Cat #3725)  SENP8 primary HTS protocol: 1) Using Labcyte Echo555, dispense 10 nl of 2 mM compound into columns 5 through 48, while 10nl of 100% DMSO into columns 1 through 4. 2) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi nL, dispense 1 ul of 160 nM SENP6 in Assay Buffer into columns 3 through 48, while 1 ul of just Assay Buffer into columns 1 and 2. 3) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi nL, dispense 1 ul of 80 uM Z-RLRGG-aminoluciferine in LDR to all wells of the plate. 4) Centrifuge plates briefly 5) Incubate at room temperature for 30 min. 6) Read plates on a Perkin Elmer Envision 2104 plate reader using the ultra-sensitive luminescence mode.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response screening assay for agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R). The purpose of this assay is to determine vasopressin receptor 1 (V1) dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 2797), and "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 434964), and that were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 434969), and "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435). In this assay a CHO cell line stably transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-62, and for inactive compounds 58-0.

Description:  Formyl peptide receptors. The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the originating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily. The present assay was undertaken to identify which of the 15 test compounds active in dose-response assays were FPR antagonists. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent the rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPR peptide agonist, fMLFF. The assay was performed in low throughput mode in a flow cytometer. Calcium response experiments were done as previously described with minor modifications. U937 cells expressing FPR were resuspended in warm tissue culture medium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 200 nanoM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After incubation, Fluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB medium (110 milliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) human serum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, and stored on ice. To assess the ability of test compounds to block FPR-induced intracellular calcium responses, Fluo4-loaded cells (1 x 10^6/milliL in 100 microL) were first incubated with or without the compound for 8 minutes at 37 degrees C (final concentrations of 0 or 100 microM test compound, 1% v/v DMSO). Cells were next analyzed for 20 seconds in a FACScanTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to establish a baseline for Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Finally, a 100 microL volume of HHB containing 0 or 1 nanoM of fMLFF peptide was manually added and the analysis was reinitiated for an additional 80 seconds. For the duration of data collection the cell suspension was maintained at 37 degrees C and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirbar. Fluo4 fluorescence was excited at 488 nM and its emission intensity analyzed at 530 nm. The median Fluo4 fluorescence intensity MFI was determined at 0.6 second intervals, ~500 cells in each interval, throughout the analysis. The MFI values were summed and averaged for the 20 seconds prior to stimulus addition (Avg_MFI_Base). The MFI values were summed over 114 measurements made during the last 70 seconds post-addition to determine the area under the response curve post-addition (AUC_Post). Avg_MFI_Base was multiplied by 114 to obtain a baseline area under the curve estimate (AUC_Base). The response to stimulus was calculated as the difference: AUC_Response = AUC_Post - AUC_Base AUC_Response was calculated for 3 conditions: 1) no test compound present and fMLFF added as stimulus (Rmax), 2) test compound present and fMLFF added as stimulus (Rtest), and 3) test compound present and HHB medium alone added as stimulus (Rmin). Test compound inhibition of the calcium response was calculated as: %Inhibition = 100 x {1 - [(Rtest - Rmin)/(Rmax - Rmin)]} Activity Scoring Test compounds resulting in greater than 90% inhibition of were considered active antagonists. The activity score was calculated for active test compounds as follows: Activity Score = 100 x (Inhib_Test - Inhib_Min)/(Inhib_Max - Inhib_Min) in which Inhib_Test was inhibition mediated by the test compound, Inhib_Min was 90 (the threshold for an active test compound), and Inhib_Max was the maximum inhibition observed for all test compounds. Compounds resulting in 90% inhibition or less were assigned an activity score of 0.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/20 ul well 1 day prior to assay in Assay Media (DMEM with 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo-4 AM dye (1 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 2.5mM probenecid) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for 45 min to one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells. 6. 20 ul of assay buffer is added and removed. 20 ul of assay buffer is added. 8. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 9. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value at the time point immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The maximum fluorescence increase beginning after the agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Compounds were not active as a positive allosteric modulators of rat mGluR1 and were assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) or EC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 10uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO (Sigma D8418) 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Dynorphin final concentration was 1uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate.

Description:  Recombinantly expresssed KvBeta was combined with 10uM test compound. Substrate turnover was measured using the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme-bound cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). If KVbeta catalyzed the reduction of the test compound, NADPH was oxidized, and consequently, the fluorescence signal from NADPH decreased over time. 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (4CY) was used as the positive control, and the compound vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was used a the negative control.The Hamamatsu FDSS kinetic plate reader equipped with 340nm excitation and 460nm emission filters was used for data collection. 1. 15nL of test compounds were transferred to columns 3-22 of a Corning low volume, black wall, clear bottom, 384-well plate. 2. Compounds were diluted with 10uL of PBS. 3. 10uL of 15mM 4CY or 0.1% DMSO were added to columns 1, 2, 23 and 24 as the positive and negative controls, respectively. 4. 5uL of 1.5 OD280nm KvBeta was added to each well to initiate the enzymatic reaction. 5. The assay was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with kinetic reads at 10 second intervals. Data Processing: 1. Fluorescence intensity versus seconds was used to calculate the slope of the response curve between 20seconds and 320seconds. Slope values resulted from a linear fit of 30 iterations or from a chi squared convergence equal to 0.0001. 2. Calculated slope values were treated as a Gaussian distribution. 3. Compounds given a 'Score' of 100 and 'Outcome' of Active had slope values that differed from the mean sample distribution at 99.7% confidence level.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-015) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases. Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted pyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to be crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications included functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the 3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to the fully unsaturated pyrazole. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-024) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.

Description:  The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma is a transcription factor that has a central role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been implicated in graft versus host disease, autoimmune disease and asthma. ROR gamma is induced in naive T helper cells in the presence of TGF-beta combined with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23, and thereafter directs the expression of the Th17 lineage cytokines. To identify nonspecific inhibitors, a Drosophila Schneider cell line was stably transfected with two vectors: a gene expressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the transactivation domain of the viral transcription factor VP16, under the control of the metallothionine promoter and a Photinus luciferase reporter regulated by the Gal4 binding site enhancer, UAS. The addition of copper to the medium induced expression of the Gal4-VP16 gamma fusion that subsequently induced the UAS-luciferase reporter. Small molecule inhibitors that inhibit components common to the RORgt and VP16 assays, such as the Gal4 DNA binding domain or the UAS luciferase reporter, will be active in both assays and thus scored as nonspecific. For screening, 600 cells in 4 uL/well were dispensed into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature, and 1 uL/well copper sulfate (700 uM final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 20 hr at ambient temperature. After addition of 1.5 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1321), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1410), were non-selective inhibitors of protein degradation, as measured by inhibition of cyclin B degradation. The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid that encodes a cyclin B-luciferase fusion protein to monitor cyclin B levels.  The cyclin B-luciferase complex is rapidly turned over in these cells. As designed, compounds that inhibit cyclin B degradation will increase cyclin B-luciferase stability, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. HeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen-strep-neo antibiotic mixture at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Cells were transiently transfected in flasks by mixing 6 million cells with 29 micrograms of the Cyclin B-luciferase plasmid complexed with 87 ul of TransIT-LT1 reagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per mL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at -80 degrees C until needed. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 microliters of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compounds in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration), or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% activation) to the appropriate wells. The plates were next incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was then stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. Previously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) were screened to identity FPRL1 ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID 520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary intracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule FPRL1 antagonists. In the present analysis, 2 major chemotype families representing the most potent FPRL1 ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational screening techniques (2D substructure search) to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased for physical screening. The FPR primary HTS counterscreen assay was performed in 384 well format. Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration ranging from 3.9 to 8.3 microM (mean +- SD = 5.5 +- 0.8 microM) for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPR. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M3 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca. EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compound dose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for compounds with EC50<1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50>1uM. All other compounds were assigned as 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 agonists: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1509), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1523), were nonselective agonists due to activation of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 625,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (5 uM final concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA, was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control)) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing S1P. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 13 and active compounds range of activity score is 13 to 100.

Description:  The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that auto fluoresce under these conditions. A total of 76 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 50 uM. Compounds with more than 20% inhibition at 50 uM were then tested in dose response assays at eight concentrations, ranging from 100 uM to 0.625 uM depending on the % inhibition for each compound in the initial 50 uM screen. To confirm that the compounds were specifically inhibiting DPM-DC and not one of the other enzymes in the assay, the compounds were tested in parallel in an assay that contained hexokinase as the enzyme instead of DPM-DC and glucose as the substrate instead of diphosphomevalonate.  None of the compounds tested inhibited in this "coupling enzymes" assay. Diphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 0.5 mL Fluorescence Cuvet Assay Purified recombinant DPM-DC enzyme was provided by Dr. Thomas Leyh, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. 236 uL of DPM-DC reagent mix which included NADH, diphosphomevalonate, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, MgCl2, KCl, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in buffer was added to each 0.5 mL fluorescence cuvet. Compounds were then added to the cuvets in 4 uL volumes in DMSO. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 160 uL of DPM-DC, diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.02 mM NADH, 0.005 mM diphosphomelalonate, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.4 mM ATP, 2 mM potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/mL each of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, 1% DMSO, and 30 nM DPM-DC enzyme diluted in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8) in a final volume of 400 uL. The cuvets were immediately transferred to an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) and reduction in fluorescence was measured for 3 minutes. Each compound was tested in triplicate for the initial 50 uM screen and for the dose response assays each concentration was in triplicate.  Full reaction controls were assays with 4 uL of DMSO added instead of compound.  Background controls were assays in which 160 uL of assay buffer was added instead of DPM-DC.  The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing DPM-DC with hexokinase and diphosphomevalonate with glucose.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers).  Compounds that cause an increase in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity.  Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027).  Following overnight growth, 100 nL of 3.75 mM compound was added to the cell solutions (7.5 uM final [compound]).  The calibration control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in dose (12-point, 2-fold dilution, from 20 uM final [compound]) and was incorporated at the beginning and end of each days run.  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added.  The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured.  Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2.  Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge.  The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media.  Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions).  Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions).  Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carosel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carosel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) for Y. pseudotuberculosis(YP126) growth. Materials: 1) Testing was done in Mueller-Hinton II broth (BBL). Protocols: 1) Approximately 106 of YP126 bacteria were inoculated into 1 ml of broth containing serial dilutions of the compound to be tested. 2) After overnight incubation at 40 oC, the optical density was read at 600nm and compared to the growth without inhibitor. 3) The MIC was read as the concentration producing a greater than 2-fold reduction in growth

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) in triplicate. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)," (AID 1800) are nonselective due to direct DNA binding. In this assay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent intercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the intercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will compete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.9 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene aceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin oligonucleotide. Well fluorescence was read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent Displacement = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Counterscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent displacement of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % displacement values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-34, for inactive 33-0. List of Reagents: DNA hairpin oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized) Intercalating agent (Ethidium Bromide) (Bio-Rad, part 161-0433) Diminazene Aceturate (Sigma-Aldrich, part D7770) MOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)

Description:  Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation. The pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain typically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly reversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of enzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of enzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating the ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a wide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has recently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6]. To identify inhibitors of USP2a a cell-free assay was employed. This assay takes advantage of attaching an Ub or UBL (ubiquitin-like protein) to a reporter enzyme, rendering the reporter catalytically inactive. The reporter enzyme chosen is phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which has an absolute requirement for a free amino terminus. Thus, fusion of a UBL to the N-terminus of PLA2 inactivates PLA2.  When the UBL-PLA2 reporter enzyme is cleaved by USP2, the activated reporter can subsequently act on its substrate, which is the commercially available NBD C6-HPC (Invitrogen).  Thus, this coupled assay gives a fluorescent read-out, which is generated through the cleavage of the PLA2 reporter enzyme. The assay, developed by Progenra, Inc. uses Ub-PLA2 and USP2a at near equal and low (nM) amounts and has been licensed for sale by LifeSensors, Inc. as the Ub-IsoPro1 kit. The assay buffer, prepared fresh at the day of the assay, contains 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM CaCl2, 2mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DMSO. 3ul of 40nM (20nM final) USP2 core, which is stored on ice, is dispensed into a medium-binding black solid Kalypsys 1,536 well plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. The assay plate is then pinned with 23nL compound with the Kalypsys pintool in columns 5-48. The controls are pinned as follows: column 1&2 two-fold dilutions of 2M NEM in duplicate; column 3 DMSO; column 4 2M NEM (final concentration 38.2mM). The assay plate is incubated at RT for 30min. Subsequently, 3uL of 40nM (20nM final) Ub-PLA2 and 40uM (20uM final) NBD C6-HPC (stored on ice and protected from light) were dispensed into the plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. Plates were read immediately (0 Hour) on an Envision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader using the following wavelengths Ex 460nm /Em 535nm. Then, the assay plates were incubated for 2.5 hours and read again on the Envision using the same settings Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (NEM). Concentration-response curves were fitted to the normalized data and the concentration-response curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. The time zero reading was used to flag fluorescence artifacts.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that were purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single particular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated against different GTPase targets. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of Ca2+-ionophore (A23187)-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with compounds found to show less than 50% inhibition in an SFLLRN-induced FITC phalloidin assay.  Platelet samples were incubated with 30 uM compound. Following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 10 uM A23187.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a specificity assay, along with an analogous assay using PMA-induced activation of platelets, to determine selectivity towards G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR).  Compounds that do not inhibit surface expression of P-selectin from PMA-induced and Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation are classified as potential GPCR-selective inhibitors. Ca2+-ionophore -induced P-selectin assay protocol: 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were incubated with 30uM compound. 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 10 uM A23187. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Fluorescence-based cell-based dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R; HCRTR2), run by assay provider. Assay Overview: The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) (AID 434989), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492963) are non-selective due to activation of OX2R. In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX2R receptor (CHO/OX2R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the Calcium5 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX2R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate using in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 88.8 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX2R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 10 ug/mL Blasticidin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and Amphotericin B). The day before the assay 10,000 cells in 25 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 384 well PDL coated black plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for ~15 hours. Next, media was gently removed (by tapping plate on absorbent tissue) and exchanged with HBSS-20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 @ RT), 2.5 mM Probenecid, 0.5% DMSO at 2 5uL/well. 25 uL of the Calcium5, 1X dye (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes in dark @ room temperature. 6.25 uL of antagonist (in assay buffer: HBSS-20mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, 4.5% DMSO) was added and incubated for another 30 minutes in dark at room temperature. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (665 nm/620 nm) for 10 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 6.25 uL of Orexin-A agonist in HBSS-20mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, 0.5% DMSO, were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 60 seconds of the assay. In this assay, test compounds are wells containing test compound, low controls are wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge (50 nM) + 10 uM Antagonist, and high controls are wells containing the Orexin A peptide at 50 nM. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration using GraphPad Prism. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 88.8 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 88.8 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-89 and for inactive compounds 89-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and increase activity of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1; M1) in cells pre-treated with a known agonist. In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 are loaded with the Fluo-8 calcium indicator dye, followed by addition of test compounds and subsequent treatment with the activator acetylcholine at a concentration that results in 20% activation (EC20). As designed, compounds that act as CHRM1 PAMs will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased intracellular calcium and relative fluorescence of the indicator dye beyond that of the EC20 of acetylcholine. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO-hM1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of acetylcholine. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter on an individual plate basis, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the plate based cutoff parameter was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 78 and the active compounds have an activity score range of 50 to 100. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Molecular chaperones including Hsp70 and Hdj1 have been shown to prevent or reverse the cellular toxicity associated with Huntington's Disease and ALS in various model systems. The expression of both genes is regulated by the heat shock response mediated by activation of heat shock transcription factor which binds to the heat shock promoter element. We have performed a secondary screen of the positives emanating from the NINDS primary screen using HeLa cells containing a human Hsp70 promoter fused to the Luciferase reporter construct. Cells were exposed to a range of concentrations from 1 to 10uM in replicate. Screen: Confluent cells were detached from five10cm tissue culture plates with 1ml 1X trypsin and were re-suspended in 500ml assay medium (1:10 dilution). The cells were immediately seeded in 48 well plates (500ul per well) and were grown overnight at 37C. After 12 hrs, selected compounds were added to reach a final concentration of 1uM or 10uM (diluted with assay medium by 1000X from the 10mM stock solution in DMSO). Each plate also contained 5uM of CdCl2 induced and uninduced cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37C for 12 hours. After incubation, the medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells, followed by 1 rinse/aspirate cycle with 1XPBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution. 200ul of lysis buffer was added to each well and the plates were immediately frozen at -80C until the luciferase assay performed.For the luciferase assay, 100ul of a lysed sample (per well) and 400ul of the reaction buffer was combined in a luminometer tube. Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) was used to add 100ul of the substrate buffer to the lysed-sample/reaction-buffer mixture and read the luciferase activity. Cell Lines: HeLa human cells (ATCC #CCL-2) were stably transfected with heat shock promoter (hsp70 promoter; -188 to +150)/luciferase reporter construct. This cell line is referred to as HSE-HeLa. Growth Medium: The growth medium for HSE-HeLa was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen #121-0046) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Atlanta Biologicals #S11150), 600ug/ml G418 (Geneticin Invitrogen #11811-031). Cells were grown in 48well plates at 37C. Assay Medium: The assay medium used for drug induction was identical to the growth medium without the G418 selection agent. Assay Buffer: Cells were lysed in 200ul of BLUC (25mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8/ 10mM MgCl2 / 1% Triton X-100/ 15% Glycerol/ 1mM EDTA) with 0.5% beta-mercaptoethanol. Assay Reagent: 400ul of BLUC (described above) with 1.25mM ATP was used for each luciferase reaction.Substrate buffer: 100ul of 1mM D-luciferin (Sigma #L-9504) in 1.4mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8 was used for each luciferase reaction. Data Analysis: Each compound was tested in triplicate. The mean (Assay_Avg) and the standard deviation (Assay_SD) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software. The fold induction (Assay_Final) was calculated by taking the ratio between the Assay_Avg and the average negative control (uninduced) of the corresponding plate. EC50 (Assay_EC50) was calculated by determining the best fit curve (using the concentrations from the secondary screen) and solving for half-maximum value using Maple statistical software. Detection Reagent: D-luciferin Assay Type: mammalian-cell based Number Replicates: 2 Assay Readout: luminescence Detection Instrument: Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) Concentration Primary Screen: (uM) 1 Concentration Primary Screen: (uM) 10 Number Negative Controls: 52 Negative Control Mean: 900.0 Negative Control Standard Deviation: 321.0 Number Positive Controls: 52 Positive Control Mean: 16278.0 Positive Control Standard Deviation: 7169.0 Secondary screen: 1uM, 3uM, 5uM, 7uM, 10uM, 15uM. Cells were seeded in the 48 well plates as described above. Compounds that tested positive during the primary screen were added to reach a final concentration of 1uM, 3uM, 5uM, 7uM, 10uM, or 15uM (diluted with assay medium by 1000X from the 10mM stock solution in DMSO). Each plate also contained 5uM of CdCl2 induced and uninduced cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37C for 5 or 12 hours and luciferase activity was measured as described above.Each compound was tested in triplicate.

Description:  Escherichia coli DnaK, a homolog of heat shock protein 70, has been shown to protect denature proteins from aggregation and promote their refolding by ATP hydrolysis. DnaK, along with its two co-cohort proteins DnaJ and GrpE, forms a microbial chaperone system that shelters microorganisms from environmental stresses such as temperature, osmotic, and pH changes, carbon and/or nitrogen starvation. Seeking inhibitors against bacterial DnaK chaperone systems will lead to a new direction for the development of antimicrobial agents, as current antimicrobial compounds have shown fewer efficacies due to the rapid emergence of resistant strains involving both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. An in vitro refolding assay was developed by Chaperone Technologies to detect and quantify the activity of DnaK. Firefly luciferase was chemically denatured and used as a substrate for the chaperone system. Luminescence readout was then used to detect the refolding of luciferase enzyme. The Emory Center has optimized and adapted the assay to a 384-well format for HTS and was able to consistently achieve a signal to noise ratio of above 8 and a Z prime factor of above 0.5. Escherichia coli DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE proteins were purchased commercially through Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, Michigan), Luciferase enzyme was from Sigma. Promega's Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System was used for the luminescence detection. DnaK refolding assay was screened against LOPAC 1280 library from Sigma at 10 uM with 2% DMSO. Screening for DnaK inhibitors was carried out in three steps: chemical denaturation of firefly luciferase, chaperone induced refolding, and detection of luciferase levels.

Description:  Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs) are rare genetic disorders in the synthesis of N-linked glycan chains. Mutations in PMM2, encoding phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2, Man-6-P-> Man-1-P) cause the most common form, CDG-Ia. Patients have a host of problems including hypotonia, variable psychomotor retardation, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and protein losing enteropathy. There is no therapy for this disorder. A current approach to ameliorate the physiological conditions associated with CDG-Ia is to provide high influx of mannose for patience. We previously developed a HTS assay through the MLSCN to identify inhibitors of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) (Fructose-6-P->Mannose-6-P) (AID 1545) to identify inhibitors of PMI that would allow directing the administered mannose into the glycosylation pathway rather than shunting it to glycolysis via the PMI link.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P3 antagonists: Dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor Subtype 1E (5HT1E). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary HTS Assay for S1P3 Antagonists," (PubChem AID 485) and that confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based assay to identify S1P3 antagonists," (PubChem AID 1429), were non-selective GPCR antagonists, as measured by inhibition of 5HT1E. In this assay, a CHO cell line containing the human 5HT1E receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein, and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under the control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure 5HT1E antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of 5HT1E by agonist induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha15 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a BLA FRET substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a 5HT1E antagonist will decrease well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum , 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mg/mL Geneticin, 5 micrograms /mL Blasticidin, 100 micrograms/ml Zeocin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/mL in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well of a 384-well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then, 50 nL of either test compound or DMSO control was added to the appropriate wells, in the presence of 1.1 ul of the selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 (3 nM final nominal EC90 concentration). Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation 2 ul/well of the GeneBlazer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, the plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" (ie, fluorescence values from wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = 100*(1-((Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control # Median_Ratio_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and BRL-54443, Low_Control is defined as wells containing BRL-54443, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.7 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.7 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. Active compounds of this assay fall into the activity score range of 53 to 100 and inactive compounds have range of activity score from 0 to 50.

Description:  This assay was developed and performed as a counter assay for the primary assay originally identified as "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 493098. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.  A probe that is selective against APJ (within equipotent range as defined by a >10-fold difference in IC50) is desired. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect antagonists that inhibit the activation of the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

Description:  Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (PubChem AID 1359). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y2 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 34 and active compounds range of activity score is 35 to 100.

Description:  HEK-293 stably transfected with the pUC13-4xNFkB-Luc were cultured in T-175 flasks (Corning part#431080) at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 11965-092) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen part#ant-pr-1). Prior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 625,000 cells per milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 21063-029) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen part#ant-pr-1). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well (i.e. 2,500 cells/well) of a white solid-bottom 1536-well plate. Plates were then placed in the incubator overnight at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity. Twenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with 15 nL/well of test compounds or positive and negative controls (10 micromolar of Chembridge compound part#5653914 and DMSO, respectively). Each compound dilution was assayed in triplicate, for a nominal total of 30 data points per dose response. One hour later, cells were stimulated with 1 microliter per well of a PBS mix of PMA (100ng/mL, Calbiochem part#524400) and ionomycin (50ng/mL, Calbiochem part#407950). Plates were subsequently returned to the incubator for 16 hours (37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity). After the incubation, plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 20 minutes. A luciferase assay was then performed by adding 5 microliters per well of the SteadyLite HTS reagent (Perkin Elmer part#6016989). After a 15 minutes incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 7 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Cys (Aldrich cat# 861677), 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 7 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  PKA is an ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase and belongs to the AGC kinase family. It has several functions in the cell, including regulation of immune response, transcription, cell cycle and apoptosis. PKA is a cAMP dependent enzyme that exists in its native inactive form as a 4 subunit enzyme with two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit leads to the disassembly of the complex and release of now active catalytic subunits. This screen is designed to identify inhibitors of PKA.The known PKA inhibitor Staurosoporine was used as a positive control. References: The assay is based on ability of PKA kinase to phosphorylate a Kemptide peptide sequence. PKA uses ATP as a donor of phosphate for the phosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay kit (#Kinase-Glo#, Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Residual amounts of ATP are measured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, during which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to produce luminescence. In this assay, the luminescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of ATP and inversely proportional to PKA activity. The primary HTS campaign was conducted in 1536 well plate format. All compounds were tested once at a 6 micromolar final Protocol Summary: 1.25 microliters of substrate solution containing 20 micromolar ATP and 60 micromolar Kemptide peptide (substrate) in assay buffer (50 millimolar HEPES pH 7.3, 10 millimolar MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2 millimolar DTT) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 15 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative control (50 micromolar Staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The experiment was started by dispensing 1.25 microliters of 0.5 nanomolar PKA in assay buffer (50 millimolar HEPES pH 7.3, 10 millimolar MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2 millimolar DTT). After 2 hours of incubation, 2.5 microliters of Kinase Glo reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes and luminescence was read on Perkin-Elmer Viewlux for 60 seconds.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell culture, plating, and dye loading. HEK/GIRK cells stably expressing the M4 muscarinic receptor were grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12, 10 percent fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 700 ug/ml G418. The rat mGluR4 cell line was prepared by PCR amplification of the entire coding sequence of each receptor and cloning into pIRES puro 3 (Invitrogen). Cloning sites were BamHI/Not I. HEK/GIRK/M4 cells were transfected with 24 ug of DNA and stable transfectants were selected with puromycin. And a monoclonal cell lines was established. Cells were grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12, 10percent fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine (Growth Media). mGluR/GIRK lines were supplemented with 600 ng/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 700 ug/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells for experiments were generally maintained for approximately 15-20 passages; this was particularly important for experiments examining the endogenous alpha2C receptor. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Cells were plated into 384 well, black-walled, clear-bottom poly-D-lysine coated plates (Greiner) at a density of 15,000 cells/20 uL/well in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Assay Media). Plated cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 percent CO2. The following day, the medium was removed from the cells and 20 uL/well of 1.7 uM concentration of the indicator dye BTC-AM (Invitrogen; prepared as a stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pluronic acid F-127) in Assay Buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen) containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3) was added to the plated cells. Cells were incubated for one hour at room temperature and the dye was replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compound preparation. Glutamate was diluted in Thallium Buffer (125 mM sodium bicarbonate (added fresh the morning of the experiment), 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8 mM calcium sulfate, 5 mM glucose, 12 mM thallium sulfate, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) at 5x the final concentration to be assayed. For fold shift experiments, compounds were diluted to a 60 uM (2x final) concentration in Assay Buffer. Cell plates and compound plates were loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Appropriate baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm emission, 540+/-30 nm) and test compounds were added. Compounds were added in a 20 uL volume and incubated for approximately 2.5 minutes prior to the addition of 10 ul of Thallium Buffer +/- agonist. After the addition of agonist, data were collected for an additional 2 min. Thallium sulfate requires special handling and disposal precautions and investigators are cautioned to contact their Environmental Health and Safety Department to ensure proper procedures are followed. Data analysis. Data were analyzed using usoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate 3 fold or less, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '1'. For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate greater than 3 fold, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. 'Score' was assigned as '50' for those with a fold-shift less than or equal to 10 or as '100' for those with a fold-shift greater than 10.

Description:  Thyroid receptor (TR) regulates many homeostatic processes including basal metabolism, cardiovascular function, body weight, and lipid trafficking. TR modulators are potential therapeutics for obesity and hyperlipidemias but current thyroid analogs have undesirable side effects, particularly cardiac stimulation. This secondary assay characterized selected actives identified in the qHTS for Inhibitors of the Interaction of Thyroid Hormone Receptor and Steroid Receptor Coregulator 2. The human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line WRO (kindly provided by Dr. M. D. Ringel) stably expresses TRbeta and a luciferase reporter gene fused to TR response element. The effect of compounds on the viability of these cells was assessed by measuring ATP levels. Compounds that reduce cell viability are likely cytotoxic. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.33 mg/ml hygromycin, 0.33 mg/ml geneticin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested and resuspended at 330,000 cells/ml in assay medium (50% DMEM 50% F-12 medium without Phenol-Red (Cellgro #16-405-CV), L-glutamine, 10% heat inactivated and charcoal treated FBS, 100 uM non-essential amino acid, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin). Cells were dispensed at 10,000 cells/30 ul/well into 384 well plates (Corning 3917) and incubated 12 h at 37 C and 5% CO2. Compounds and T3 (100nM final concentration) were added using a pin tool and plates were incubated 16 h incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, plates were equilibrated at ambient temperature for 30 min, 20 ul of CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was added and luminescence was detected by an EnVision (PerkinElmer).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase reticulocyte (hPK-R) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. R-isoform Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC80 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-023) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  To characterize binding of small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERalpha, a series of dose-response curves were completed for compounds with suggested ERalpha binding ability in primary screening using a competitive binding approach using whole cells. This assay assesses the affinity of small molecules with unknown ERalpha binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERalpha in permeabilized whole cells expressing ERalpha-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind ERalpha will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with ERalpha-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/mL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Dose-response curves are arrayed across the plate in duplicate with low concentrations in columns 3 and 14 and increasing concentrations of compounds (in 1/2-log increments) in columns 4-11 and 15-22, respectively. Columns 12 and 13 contain untransfected cells. Sixteen unknown compounds per plate were assayed in dose-responses in this manner. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 384-discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 100% binding E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using: %Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF where Sample MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from sample well and Negative Control MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from wells with vehicle (DMSO) control. These %Binding data were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression on a sigmoidal dose response model. Some dose response data converged with variable slopes (four parameter logistics equation) and some dose response data converged with Hill Slope set to 1 (three parameter logistics equation), see column entitled HILLSLOPE. Curve fit statistics reported concentration of compound at 50% effect (EC50, nanoM), low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, the Hill Slope, and the correlation coefficient (RSQR) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Reporting of EC50 estimates were made only for compound data that converged in Prism with a 95% confidence interval. Maximum EC50 reported was set at 10 microM or 10,000 nanoM. Any compound with estimate EC50 greater than this cutoff was noted with > in the ACTIVITY_QUALIFIER column. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves: %Binding at 10 microM, estimated EC50 value, magnitude of binding change over entire concentration range. A score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding of fluorescent ligand at the 10 microM point of the dose-response curve, where: 0 = 70% < %Binding 10 = 50 < %Binding < 70% 20 = 30 < %Binding < 50% 30 = %Binding < 30% A score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the estimated EC50 value (in M), where: 0 = 10^-5 < EC50 10 = 10^-6 < EC50 < 10^-5 20 = 10^-7 < EC50 < 10^-6 30 = 10^-8 < EC50 < 10^-7 40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8 50 = EC50 < 10^-9 A score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the magnitude of the dose-response curve of E2-Alexa633 binding using: MAGNITUDE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where: 0 = MAGNITUDE < 30 or MAGNITUDE > 100 10 = 30 < MAGNITUDE < 45 20 = 45 < MAGNITUDE < 100 These three scoring parameters were summed to give the possible maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds were considered "Active" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was 50 or greater and given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "Non-Active" compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE less than 50 given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (PubChem AID 1539) were nonselective due to agonism of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 16 and active compounds range of activity score is 16 to 100.

Description:  Dose Response cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds from the MLSCN library that were active in a previous screen entitled, "Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2)," (PubChem AID 866). Compounds were assessed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 42 uM.  In this assay GALR2 antagonism was measured using a cell line stably expressing human GALR2 and beta-lactamase (BLA) genes under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. Stimulation of GALR2 and coupling to Gq induces release of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and nuclear translocation of NFAT where it activates transcription of the BLA reporter gene.  In the presence of antagonist GALR2 exhibits low basal activity and cells express low BLA levels.  Thus, BLA expression is inversely proportional to antagonist concentration. Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.  As designed, a GALR2 antagonist will decrease FRET.  Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin and Geneticin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed per test well of a 1536-well plate (2000 cells/well), followed by incubation at 25 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour.  Following the incubation, the assay was started by dispensing 21 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (negative control wells) to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of 2% BSA (low control wells; in 2% BSA) or galanin (1-16) peptide (high control wells; 150 nM final nominal concentration in 2% BSA; EC80) was dispensed to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of 2% BSA was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours, followed by addition of 1 microliter/well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, well fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only.  To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 2% BSA in PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing galanin (1-16) in 2% BSA. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 42 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 42 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man, annually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. Glucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite, the bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that HK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is lethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been unsuccessful. Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have been developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. T. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome 10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical. TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian HKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and human HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets. Indeed, it has been suggested that the possibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long sought-after inhibitors a possibility. Thus, a simple "mix and read" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the enzyme.  Basic High Throughput Screening Assay protocol The basic procedure for the TbHK1 HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture components as follows: 1     15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound concentration 10 uM). 2 15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of 0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively. 3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL). 4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. 5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). 6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH        in the reaction mixture.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence-based dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 5 (S1P5) counterscreen assay. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether powder samples of compounds identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107) were nonselective agonists as assayed by activation of S1P3. This assay uses Tango S1P5-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 8 (EDG8; S1P5) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P5 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P5 agonists will stimulate migration of the fusion protein, thus increasing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to an increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 ug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 275,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate (10000 cells/well), followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (1.5 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Selected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100, and for inactive compounds 0-0.

Description:  The cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of drug dependence and addiction disorders.  GPR55, an orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, has been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor, but its status as such remains unresolved due to conflicting results from pharmacological studies.  The goal of the project is to identify small molecule agonists of GPR55, which may aid in the deorphanization efforts of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR55 in drug addiction. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPR55 activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits and further into endosomal vesicles.  This arrestin-GFP redistribution is measured as increased local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins.  Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR55 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 100ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Lysophosphatidylinositol (Sigma L7635, 5mM stock in Methanol water) diluted in water to 250uM.  Additional DMSO is added to achieve a DMSO concentration of 2.5%. 5) Negative Control Working Solution: 2.5% DMSO diluted in water. 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Primary Screen Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman): a) 5ul of 100uM compound solution was added to columns 3 through 24 of the assay plates for a final assay compound concentration of 10uM and 0.25% DMSO.  b) 5ul of negative control (2.5% DMSO) working solution was added to column 2. c) 5ul of the positive control (250uM LPI) working solution was added to column 1.  5) Plates were incubated for 75 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Hit Confirmation Procedure: 1) The same procedure as used for primary screen (above) steps 1 to 3. 2) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The 'dose response protocol' was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 32uM to 500nM, in duplicate (seven doses). b. Positive control was added to column 1.  LPI final concentration was 25uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.3%. 3) Primary screen procedure (above) steps 5 to 10 were followed.  Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings:   20x 0.45 NA air objective   Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels   2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emisssion filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters   2 fields per well for Primary screen   4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.

Description:       BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes(DUB). These proteases reverse the conjugation of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. 1. Dilute BAP1 and Ub-AMC (provided by investigator) using Tris-HCl Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 10 mM DTT). 2. Add 25 ul of BAP1 (5 nM) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls. 3. Transfer compounds (2 mM in DMSO) to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations. 4. Add 25 ul of 800 nM Ub-AMC. 5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using the kinetic settings.      An excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 425 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 400 nm. The plate was read every 1'45" for 15 times. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% level of Y-intercept.  When the highest concentration tested (50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as greater than 50 micromolar. Similarly, when the lowest concentration tested (1.5625 micromolar) resulted in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as less than 1.5625 micromolar.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-016) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 100 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Damgo final concentration was 1 uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml.

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  CD4-TLR4 overexpresssion induced NF-kB luciferase in 293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells is developed and performed to test whether the compound SID 17450324 inhibits TLR4 induced NF-kB pathway.  SID 17450324 was identified in earlier assays, 1266, 1269, 1270, 1287 and 1368 as a possible candidate to selectively inhibit NF-kB activation. We stimulated the TLR-pathway by transfection with a CD4-TLR4 fusion protein, in which the extracellular domain of CD4 is fused with the transmembrane and cytosolic domain of TLR4. Materials, 1. HEK293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells 2. pcDNA3 plasmid 3. pcDNA-CD4-TLR4 plasmid 4. pTK-luc (Renilla-luciferase) plasmid (Promega) 5. lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 6. Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) 7. Dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) Protocol. 1. HEK293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells were seeded in white 96-well plates at a density of 1*10(4) in 70 uL antibiotic free medium supplemented with 10% FBS for overnight. 2. 5uL of diluted compounds was added to reach desired final concentration for 2 h 3. Transfection: pTK-Luc with pcDNA3 or with pcDNA-CD4-TLR4 (ratio 1:10, total DNA 100ng) was added into 12.5uL Opti-MEM for 5 min. 0.2uL Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 12.5 uL Opti-MEM for 5 min. The above DNA solution and Lipofectamine 2000 solution was mixed for 15 min and 25 uL of the final mixture was added into each well. 4. 48 h later, the culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed once with PBS, prior to adding 50 uL per well of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), firefly luciferase activity and renilla luciferase activity were measured using Dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). 5. The firely luciferase activity was normalized by the renilla luciferase activity. pcDNA3 transfection induced NF-kB activity was set to 1 and all the data were processed and presented as the fold increase over pcDNA3 tranfection.

Description:  The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that autofluoresce under these conditions. Despite using a kinetic assay some compounds were too intensely fluorescent to be evaluated correctly and were not considered for follow up dose response studies. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for DPM-DC inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty non-autofluorescent compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited DPM-DC and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of DPM-DC. Diphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 384-well HTS Final Assay concentrations:  25 uL/well 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 4 mM MgCl2 0.4 mM ATP 5uM diphosphomevalonate (DPM) 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate 20 uM NADH 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (Sigma) 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (Sigma) 30 nM of DPM-DC 4% DMSO Background conditions are the same as above except that the substrate (DPM) is left out. The assay was run in 384-well black opque plates.  Fifteen ul substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 ul volumes using the FX.  The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ul of DPM-DC using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in fluorescence was measured (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the MK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing DPM-DC with hexokinase.

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor beta (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. The purpose of this assay to use HTS to identify inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb-SMMHC, a potential therapeutic approach for inv(16) related leukemia. This is accomplished by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. When added together Cerulean-Runt domain and Venus-CBFb-SMMHC will bind and allow for energy transfer. If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the FRET signal will be abated. 1) Cerulean-Runt domain and Venus-CBFb-SMMHC was provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA).  2) Fluorescent CBFa/b complex working solution: 50 nM Cerulean-Runt (CBFa) domain, 50 nM Venus-CBFb-SMMHC in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM K2SO4, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, and 0.0125% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1h. 3) Positive control (PC) solution contained untagged CBFb-SMMHC added at 1.25 uM concentration to the CBFa/b working solution uHTS protocol: 1) 4ul of CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 48 of a black 1536-well plate (Corning #3724) 2) 4ul of positive control is added to the wells in columns 1 and 2. 3) 40nl of 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns 1 through 4, while 40nl of 2mM compounds in 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns  5 through 48.  Final compound concentration is 20uM, final DMSO concentration is 1%. 4) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 5) After 1 hour the plate is read on a BMG Pherastar 422ex, 530em and 480em 6) The FRET signal is determined as the ratio of 530/480 signals. Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were 2-fold serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.  2) 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 3) 16 ul of CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 24 of a black 384-well plate (Greiner #784076) 4) 16 ul of positive control is added to columns 1 and 2. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) After 1 hour the plate is read on a BMG Pherastar 422ex, 530em and 480em 7) The FRET signal is determined as the ratio of 530/480 signals.

Description:  Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer, genetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor suppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is essential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer therapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search for homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step of HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and stimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. Our goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as chemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer therapies. DNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51 protein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this assay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides (47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm and the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with the sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the photon emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an increase in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the duplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA strand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this fluorescence. Materials Human Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence assay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer salts were from Sigma. Assay hRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min). Compounds (10 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by addition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min and then plates were read on Envision plate reader. HTS protocol 1.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop 2.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool 3. Add 4 ul reaction mix (containing hRad 51 and ss DNA with buffers) 4.Preincubate compound with the reaction mix for 30 min at room temperature 5. Add 2 ul ds DNA 6.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min 7.Read fluorescence on Envision reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 520 nm) Data analysis The data was analyzed in IDBS Activity Base XE. Each HTS plate had a single test compound (10 uM in 1.7% DMSO) in columns 3-22, controls (1.7% DMSO) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (heterologous ss DNA) in columns 1 and 23. Percent inhibition was calculated for each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Inhibition = 100*(1-((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)))

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (AID 1700), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled "Luminescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (AID 1834), and that were inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for KLF5 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line in triplicate" (AID 1905). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether these compounds are cytotoxic to non-transformed IEC-6 rat intestinal epithelial cells. In this assay, rat IEC-6 cells are incubated with tests compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega) to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological  change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was not active as a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR3 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'

Description:  LYP, is a lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical regulatory role in T cell receptor signaling. The PTPN22 gene encodes this phosphatase. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in PTPN22 is associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Grave's disease. The autoimmunity-predisposing allele is a gain-of-function mutant suggesting that a specific small-molecule inhibitor could eliminate its effect. Finding specific inhibitors of protein phosphatases has proven extremely difficult.

Description:  Recombinant human cathepsin S was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219343). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1160.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin S (0.04 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. Activity of single compounds identified from mixture HTS were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.08 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation. The pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain typically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly reversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of enzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of enzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating the ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a wide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has recently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6]. To identify inhibitors of USP2a a cell-free assay was employed. This assay takes advantage of attaching an Ub or UBL (ubiquitin-like protein) to a reporter enzyme, rendering the reporter catalytically inactive. The reporter enzyme chosen is phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which has an absolute requirement for a free amino terminus. Thus, fusion of a UBL to the N-terminus of PLA2 inactivates PLA2. When the UBL-PLA2 reporter enzyme is cleaved by USP2, the activated reporter can subsequently act on its substrate, which is the commercially available NBD C6-HPC (Invitrogen). Thus, this coupled assay gives a fluorescent read-out, which is generated through the cleavage of the PLA2 reporter enzyme. The assay, developed by Progenra, Inc. uses Ub-PLA2 and USP2a at near equal and low (nM) amounts and has been licensed for sale by LifeSensors, Inc. as the Ub-IsoPro1 kit. The assay buffer, prepared fresh at the day of the assay, contains 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM CaCl2, 2mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DMSO. 3ul of 40nM (20nM final) USP2 core, which is stored on ice, is dispensed into a medium-binding black solid Kalypsys 1,536 well plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. The assay plate is then pinned with 23nL compound with the Kalypsys pintool in columns 5-48. The controls are pinned as follows: column 1&2 two-fold dilutions of 2M NEM in duplicate; column 3 DMSO; column 4 2M NEM (final concentration 38.2mM). The assay plate is incubated at RT for 30min. Subsequently, 3uL of 40nM (20nM final) Ub-PLA2 and 40uM (20uM final) NBD C6-HPC (stored on ice and protected from light) were dispensed into the plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. Plates were read immediately (0 Hour) on an Envision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader using the following wavelengths Ex 460nm /Em 535nm. Then, the assay plates were incubated for 2.5 hours and read again on the Envision using the same settings Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (NEM). Concentration-response curves were fitted to the normalized data and the concentration-response curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. The time zero reading was used to flag fluorescence artifacts.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell culture, plating, and dye loading. HEK/GIRK cells stably expressing the M4 muscarinic receptor were grown in 45% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45% Ham's F12, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 700 ug/ml G418. The rat mGluR4 cell line was prepared by PCR amplification of the entire coding sequence of each receptor and cloning into pIRES puro 3 (Invitrogen). Cloning sites were BamHI/Not I. HEK/GIRK/M4 cells were transfected with 24 ug of DNA and stable transfectants were selected with puromycin. And a monoclonal cell lines was established. Cells were grown in 45% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45% Ham's F12, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine (Growth Media. mGluR/GIRK lines were supplemented with 600 ng/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 700 ug/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells for experiments were generally maintained for approximately 15-20 passages; this was particularly important for experiments examining the endogenous alpha2C receptor. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Cells were plated into 384 well, black-walled, clear-bottom poly-D-lysine coated plates (Greiner) at a density of 15,000 cells/20 uL/well in DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Assay Media). Plated cells were incubated overnight at 37 oC in the presence of 5% CO2. The following day, the medium was removed from the cells and 20 uL/well of 1.7 uM concentration of the indicator dye BTC-AM (Invitrogen; prepared as a stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pluronic acid F-127) in Assay Buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen) containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3) was added to the plated cells. Cells were incubated for one hour at room temperature and the dye was replaced with the 20 ul of Assay Buffer. Test compound preparation. Agonists were diluted in Thallium Buffer (125 mM sodium bicarbonate (added fresh the morning of the experiment), 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8 mM calcium sulfate, 5 mM glucose, 12 mM thallium sulfate, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) at 5x the final concentration to be assayed. For concentration-response curve experiments, compounds were serially diluted 1:3 into 10 point concentration response curves in DMSO, transferred to daughter plates using the Echo, and diluted in Assay Buffer to a 2X final concentration. Cell plates and compound plates were loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Appropriate baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm emission, 540+/-30 nm) and test compounds were added. Compounds were added in a 20 ul volume and incubated for approximately 2.5 minutes prior to the addition of 10 ul of Thallium Buffer +/- agonist. After the addition of agonist, data were collected for an additional 2 min. Thallium sulfate requires special handling and disposal precautions and investigators are cautioned to contact their Environmental Health and Safety Department to ensure proper procedures are followed. Data analysis. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For compounds with an average EC50 equal to or greater than 100uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' as '1'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 100uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active.' For compounds with average EC50's less than or equal to 10uM, 'Score' was asssigned as '50'. For compounds with average EC50's less than or equal to 1uM, 'Score was assigned as '100'.

Description:   The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases.  The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets.  In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the NOD1 and NOD2 genes are associated with a number of human inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD), Blau syndrome, early-onset sarcoidosis, and atopic diseases, which characteristically cause constitutive NF-kB activation. Chemical inhibitors of NOD1 and NOD2 would provide powerful research tools for elucidating the roles of these proteins in primary cultured cells from humans and in animal models. The assay described below is a cell-based HTS assay that utilizes NF-kB-mediated luciferase reporter gene activity as a measure of NOD1 modulation.  The assay uses a luminescent readout. 1) HEK-293-T NFKB-Luc cell line obtained from the assay provider's laboratory. 2) g-tri-DAP (Ana Spec cat #60774) obtained from assay provider's laboratory. 3) SteadyGlo (Promega) Primary Screen and Single-concentration confirmation Day 1 Procedure 1) Harvest HEK-293-T NFKB-Luc at 100% confluency 2) Dispense 3 uL (6000 cells)/well to every well of a 1536 TC-treated white plate (Corning # 3727). 3) Spin down plates at 1000 rpm for 1 min in an Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge. 4) Using a HighRes biosolution pintool equipped with V&P Scientific pins, stamp 10nl of 2mM cmpds in DMSO (col 5-48) and  10nl DMSO controls (col 1-4) to plates 5) Lid Plates.

Description:  This functional assay was developed for detection of compounds inhibiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. These compounds would be observed as false positives of assays employing G6PDH, e.g. cytochrome P450 enzyme assays where G6PDH is utilized in the NADPH-regenerating system. The knowledge of compounds behavior in the GAPDH assay is required for characterization of their effect in CYP450 systems. Materials: 1) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (cat # G5885 Sigma-Aldrich) 2) Beta-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (Amresco) 3) Glucose-6-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) 4) Diaphorase (Sigma-Aldrich) 5) Resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich) 6) Potassium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) Assay protocol: Assay was performed in 8-uL volume using 1536-well black plates (Corning, 3724). First, 4-uL of a solution containing G6PDH, diaphorase, and resazurin was added to each well of the assay plate followed by the addition of 20-nL of test compounds in DMSO using a V & P Scientific Pintool. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 4-uL of a solution containing NADP, MgCl2, and G6P. Assay was allowed to proceeed at room temperature for 45 minutes before being read on a PerkinElmer ViewLux. Final concentrations of components in the assay were as follows: 1) 0.025 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 2) 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 3) 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate 4) 3.3 mM magnesium chloride 5) 1.0 U/mL diaphorase 6) 1.0 mM resazurin 7) 5.0 uM compounds (columns 5-48) 8) 0.025 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 9) 0.25% DMSO (columns 1-48) 10) Above components, minus G6PDH, as a positive control (columns 1-2)

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the mesangial cell line which is derived from normal human renal glomeruli. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the mesangial cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Prostaglandin E2 that is produced by COX2 in response to cellular injury is involved in a multimodal inflammatory response in many tissues, including the brain.  Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) activation following ischemia and status epilepticus generally contributes to neuroinflammation, possibly in part via activation of EP2, a Gs-coupled GPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP. However, EP2 inhibitors that could be used to test this hypothesis are not available. We created a rat C6 glioma cell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under control of the CMV promoter. Thirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM butaprost (a selective EP2 agonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to cause cAMP accumulation in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. The subclone chosen for further study responded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from 0.057 to 58 fmoles / 6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to butaprost or the endogenous ligand, PGE2 (not shown). The primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a cAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF assay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with butaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, reduces the FRET signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was carried out for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for manipulating cell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12 hours after lysing the cells. A cell density of 2000 to 4000 cells/well in a 1536-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics. The assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is approximately 7-fold more potent than butaprost, and was used in HTS because the action of allosteric modulators is frequently influenced by the agonist chosen. The primary screen involved incubation of cells with 20 uM of library compounds, followed by a 30-40 min incubation with a saturating concentration (1 uM) of PGE2. The percent inhibition of the PGE2-induced reduction in TR-FRET signal was measured. Reagents: Cell culture medium:  500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen Strept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml  Geneticin Procedure: 1. Grow cells: Cells were grown over a week in T-175 flasks and split when appropriate to reach the final volume of 40-50 T-175 flasks necessary for screening. 2. Harvest cells: 1. Aspirate medium from T-175 flasks, rinse with HBSS without Ca-Mg. 2. Add 3 ml /flask Versene (EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml) (BioWhittaker Cat# 17-711E) 3. Tap flasks vigorously 4. Add 10 ml/flask HBSS (+Ca+Mg) and combine the cells in 4 centrifuge tubes (50ml) 5. Centrifuge cells at 800g for 8 min 6. Discard supernant 7. Resuspend cells in about 100 ml HBSS(+Ca+Mg) 8. Count cell number 3. Cell density optimization Make dilutions of PGE2 in HBSS to arrive at testing concentrations of PGE2. Make dilutions of cells to arrive at testing concentrations of cells. Add 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9 in HBSS) and incubate at RT for 10 - 40 min Add 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1:18), centrifuge plate and incubate at RT for 20min to 2 hr Read FRET signal using Envision (100us delay) Analyze data and calculate the EC50s at differen cell density Choose cell density for screening (EC50 of PGE2 is 1 - 3 nM) 4. Screening Step 1: make 250 ml of cells (for 40 1536-well plates), add 250 ul of 10 mM Rolipram Step 2:  dispense 4 ul of cells to column 3 - 46 Step 3: dispense 1 ul of HBSS to column 3 - 4 Step 4: add 0.1 ul of 1 mM compound (final compound concentration: 20 uM) using Pin-tool (Beckman NX) Step 5:  add 1 ul of 6 uM PGE2 to PGE2 control wells (final 1 uM) Step 6: add 1 ul of 120 uM Forsklin to forsklin contrl wells (final 20 uM) Step 7: dispense 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9) to column 4 Step 8: make mixture of d2-conjugate and PGE2: Step 9: dispense 2 ul of d2-conjugate and PGE2 mixture to column 5 - 46 step 10: shake plates well, centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10min, incubate at RT for around 10mins (no longer that 20 min) Step 11: dispense 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1: 18 dilution in lysis buffer) to column 3 - 46 Step 12: shake plates well,  centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10 min and incubate at RT for 10 min. Put plates to 4C refregrator before reading Step 13: Read plates uisng Envision with Twister II robot. Run 5 plates/batch from refrigerator. 5.  Data analysis: Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate. Normalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET blank(compound added)) / ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (no compound added)) % of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from control wells) * 100 % of inhibition = 100 - % of activity Where FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an average FRET ratio from wells with cells, Anti-cAMP-Eu and HBSS buffer only; FRET control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing 0.3 nM PGE2 that defines maximum FRET signal. The PubChem Activity Score is calculated by rounding the Pct Inhibition to 0 decimal places. Negative scores are changed to 0, and scores higher than 100 are changed to 100. Compounds with a PubChem Activity Score > 40 are defined as active.

Description:  Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO cell line. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous assays entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) (AID 434989), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492963) are nonselective inhibitors of Gq signaling. This assay will determine dose response curves. In this assay, the parental CHO cell line (not transfected with any GPCRs) is used to monitor inhibition of Gq activity by test compound. Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 49.8 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 - 575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Inhibition = ( 1 -( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP). For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.8 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.8 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-98 and for inactive compounds 82-0.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1778) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the identification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide novel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and either "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1546), or "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1697), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2", (AID 1359) and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704), were nonselective due to inhibition of the parental CNGC activity. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP production or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 microliters of 0.1% BSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using: % Inhibition = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-76, for inactive 60-0.

Description:  Different from that of PMA/Ionomycin which activates NF-kB via PKC, TNF induced NF-kB activation is through the TNF-receptor, TRADD and TRAF (Hsu, 1995). To exclude the hits which may affect TNF induced NF-kB pathway, we designed a counter-screening assay which utilized 293-NF-kB-Luc cells and TNF. TNF was used to stimulate NF-kB in 293-NF-kB-Luc cells. In AID-1266, PMA/Ionomycin induced NF-kB luciferase in 293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells, 18 of the compounds had IC50 &4um.  Of these SID 7970423 was shown in AID 1269 to directly inhibit luciferase activity and will not be tested in this assay. Materials: 1. HEK293-NF-kB-luc stable cells 2. TNF (R&D systems) 3. BriteLite kit for detection of firefly luciferase (Perkin-Elmer) 4. Luminometor (LJL Biosystems) Protocol: 1. HEK293-NF-kB-Luc cells (10 (4) cells in 90 uL medium) were seeded in 96-well white plates for overnight. 2. Compounds were diluted in culture medium and 5 uL was added into the cells to reach desired final concentrations 3. 2 h later, 5 uL TNF(200 ng/ml) was added (final concentration = 10 ng/ml) and cells were treated for another 16 h. 4. 50 uL BriteLite solution was added into each well and luminescence was read using a luminometer. 5. The luminescence of cells treated by TNF was set to 100% and the data of each compound were processed and presented as the percentage of control.

Description:  Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists. TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland which belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a seven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s) protein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and regulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with thyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after surgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small molecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and physiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small molecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has ever been reported. In order to confirm specificity of the compounds to the TSHR, a  confirmatory assay was conducted on a similar family member, the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) receptor, transfected into a HEK 293 cell line, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: antibody-based Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF). This line did not contain the CNG and was therefore incapable of being used in the primary assay format. Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) cAMP Assay. HEK 293 cells stably transfected with a vector containing the LH receptor and maintained under hygromycin selection were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Marvin Gershengorn. Compounds were assayed using a HTRF cAMP detection kit (Cisbio) on the LH receptor transfected cell line. Briefly, 750 cells were plated in 2.5 ul/well of complete media (DMEM containing 10 % FCS, and 100 uM RO 20-1724) in 1536 well solid bottom white plates and 23 nl/well compound in DMSO solution or controls was added. Following 30 minute incubation at room temperature, 2.5 ul/well of labeled d2 cAMP and 2.5 ul/well of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1:20 in lysis buffer) were added to each well using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora Discovery, San Diego) . Plates were measured using the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) with excitation at 330 nm and emissions of 615 nm and 660 nm.

Description:  TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland which belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a seven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s) protein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and regulates their growth and function. This cell based assay was conducted on a TSHR transfected HEK 293 cell line, measuring cAMP stimulation using antibody-based Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF). Our goal is to identify small molecules that will inhibit (antagonize) the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), a member of the 7 transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR) family of cell surface receptors. TSHR-mediated hyperthyroidism is important in thyroid pathology.  The development of small molecule antagonists of TSHR may lead to therapeutic approaches for TSHR-mediated hyperthyroidism caused by constitutively activating mutations or stimulating auto-antibodies associated with Graves' disease.  Graves' disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism and is caused by autoantibodies that stimulate TSHR (TsAbs) causing thyroid growth and unregulated overproduction of thyroid hormones and existing treatments have liabilities (agranulocytosis). In addition, TSHRs are known to be expressed in multiple extrathyroidal tissues including bone, brain, kidney, testis, fat and cells of the immune system but the role of the TSHR in these tissues is not clear.  Therefore, TSHR antagonists/inverse agonists could be used as probes of extrathyroidal TSHR function. Finally, TSHR inverse agonists, which are a subclass of antagonists that inhibit agonist-independent (or basal or constitutive) TSHR signaling, could be used to inhibit TSH-independent signaling in patients with recurrent or metastatic thyroid cancer who are receiving thyroid hormone to suppress TSH. An anti cAMP antibody contains a fluorescent cryptate tag (excitation 337 nm; emission 620 nm) and the acceptor is cAMP-d2 (excitation 620 nm; emission 665 nm). When antibody and cAMP-d2 interact and are excited by a 337 nm light, a FRET occurs resulting in emission at 665 nm. The assay is competition between cAMP-d2 and cAMP (from the cell lysate). The homogeneous protocol allows for one step dispense after stimulation that is automation friendly.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases.  The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets.  In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the NOD1 and NOD2 genes are associated with a number of human inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD), Blau syndrome, early-onset sarcoidosis, and atopic diseases, which characteristically cause constitutive NF-kB activation. Chemical inhibitors of NOD1 and NOD2 would provide powerful research tools for elucidating the roles of these proteins in primary cultured cells from humans and in animal models.

Description:  Dense granule release of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) retest at dose. Expired units of PRP obtained from a blood-distribution center were plated in 384-well white assay plates (Aurora, 00030721) on average of 15,600,000 platelets/well in 20ul. PRP was exposed to 1584 cherry picked compounds chosen based on activity of the primary screen and those with similar structure to provide some SAR data.  Compounds were plated at dose, with final testing concentrations ranging from 11.25uM to 0.875um.  The positive control, Cilostazol (Sigma #C0737, Lot# 042K4704, BRD-K67017579-001-04-2) was included on all plates to give a final screening concentration of 100uM.  Compounds were added to PRP for 30 minutes prior to addition of the thrombin receptor (Par1) activator SFLLRN (5uM, Bachem, H-8365) and detection reagent CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G755) using a modified protocol, for measurement of ATP released from the dense granules. PBS is used in place of CellTiter-Glo Buffer thus preventing platelet lysis and a high background of ATP. Luminescence measurements are taken 15 minutes after reagent addition.  The 1584 compounds were tested on two donor samples of PRP. Expected Outcome: A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit the release of dense granules from the platelets, or inhibit the luciferase enzyme. Compounds that retest positively will be those that show inhibition of signal in a dose-dependent manner in at least one of the donor PRP samples.  Normalization and curve fitting of the retest data was performed using the Genedata Screener applications. Specificity for the inhibition of platelet dense granule release will be determined in secondary assay testing for inhibition of luciferase. Taken from 2016-01-A01-012 1) Plasma bag(s) from a single donor were emptied into a sterile bottle (250 or 500ml, depending on volume of plasma) in a hood. If multiple bags exist from a single donor (matching barcodes), they were combined as to increase batch volume. Multiple donors' samples could not be pooled due to possible immunological reactions, therefore multiple batches were run daily with each being prepared singly. All information provided on each unit used was recorded (source, donor number, blood type, etc.). 2) Samples were taken to count the number of platelets/ml and checked for activation activity by addition of SFLLRN and CellTiter-Glo. 3) The Thermo MultiDrop Combi in a hood was prepared for dispensing 20ul of plasma per well. As many plates allowable with volume of plasma were filled from a single donor. Batch size ranged from 200ml-700ml. While filling, platelets were kept in homogeneous suspension by gentle agitation. 4) Assay plates were loaded into racks for placement into a Liconic STR240 HRIT incubator set at 30'C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. The incubator is docked to the screening system. Compound plates have their foil seals pierced off-line. Those plates are loaded into a Liconic STR240 DRIT incubator set to 22'C, 15% humidity. 5) CellTiter-Glo/SFLLRN was prepared for each day to a volume to accommodate the number of assay plates estimated for the day. The CellTiter-Glo Substrate was previously resuspended in 100ml PBS, aliquoted and frozen. An aliquot was thawed and diluted 1:4 with PBS. SFLLRN was previously resuspended in stocks of 10mM and frozen. An aliquot was thawed and was added to the mixture at 15uM. The Combi on the screening system was prepared for run and primed with the reagent. 6) Screening was performed on an enclosed, contained screening system (HighRes Biosolutions). The run was initiated by set-up in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario (HighRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from the different instruments on the system. Compounds were pinned into assay plates using a MicroPin (High Res Biosolutions) using a 25nl head calibrated to deliver 50nl. 7) Assay plates were returned to the incubator for a 30 min. incubation. 8) At the completion of incubation, plates moved to the Combi for addition of 10ul CellTiter-Glo/SFLLRN solution per well. 9) Plates were moved to a plate hotel on deck for a 15 min. incubation. 10) At completion of incubation, plates were moved to an Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer) for luminescence detection. The ultra sensitive detection was used, with the 1536 aperture in place, to decrease bleed-through from adjacent wells. Read time is 0.1s/well.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1321), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1410). The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid that encodes a Wee1K328M-luciferase fusion protein to monitor Wee1 levels. Wee1K328M is a kinase negative mutant used to avoid the cell growth inhibitory effects of wildtype wee1. The Wee1K328M-luciferase complex is rapidly turned over in these cells. As designed, compounds that inhibit Wee1 degradation will increase Wee1K328M-luciferase stability, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. HeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen-strep-neo antibiotic mixture at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Cells were transiently transfected in flasks by mixing 6 million cells with 29 ug of the Wee1K328M-luciferase plasmid complexed with 87 ul of TransIT-LT1 reagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per mL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at -80 degrees C until needed. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration), or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% activation) to the appropriate wells. The plates were next incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was then stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: Cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1546), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y2 Potentiator Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 32 and active compounds range of activity score is 33 to 100.

Description:  To assign functional characteristics to compounds identified in our previous binding and dose-response screens, a functional assay to assess estrogen-mediated translocation of PIP3 was employed. This assay uses the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (Protein kinase B). This PH domain binds specifically to PI(3,4,5)P3 and, when fused to RFP, can be used as a reporter of PIP3 localization in the cell at different points following stimulation. Stimulation of cells co-expressing GPR30 and PH-RFP with estrogen and other GPR30 agonists leads to a translocation of PH-RFP from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a nuclear localization. This translocation can be blocked using an GPR30 antagonist. Cos7 cells (ATCC # CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. 200,000 cells were seeded into 6- well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with GPR30-GFP and PH-RFP at a ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, per manufacturers instructions). Six hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto 12 milliM glass coverslips (7500 cells / coverslip) and allowed to adhere for 18 hours, at which point media was changed and cells were grown in phenol-red free, serum-free DMEM F-12 containing Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine for 24 hours prior to assay. Transfected cells were stimulated with compound, vehicle or estrogen to assess PI3K translocation in response to estrogen-mediated signaling. To screen for agonist activity, compound was applied to cells and incubated at 37 degreesC for 15 minutes. For assessment of antagonist activity, cells were firs incubated with potential antagonist for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, then sitmulated with low-dose estrogen (10 nanoM) for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, washed 3x with PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were stored at -20 degreesC prior to visualization. Assessment of translocation of the PI3P reporter, PH-RFP, was visually scored. Compounds which fully translocated PH-RFP to the nucleus (equal to estrogen-mediated translocation) were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds with a moderate level of PH-RFP translocation were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 50 and compounds which induced no translocation of PH-RFP were assigned a value of 0. Scoring of antagonists was as completed in a similar manner, with compunds that completely blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, compounds which partially blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a score of 50, and all inactive compounds assigned a score of 0. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME was based on the activity scores, with "Active" compunds being those with PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCOREs of 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "In-active" compounds having a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0-50 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.

Description:  The purpose of this biochemical assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)" (AID 1789). This assay monitors the ability of compounds to inhibit the refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase by Hsp90 protein (7, 8). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate is the source of Hsp90 protein. In this assay, denatured luciferase enzyme is incubated with the cell lysate in the presence of test compound. As designed, compounds that inhibit Hsp90 activity will prevent luciferase renaturation and activity, leading to a decrease in well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.9 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay, 3.75 microliters of 8.3% rabbit reticulocyte lysate were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, geldanamycin (60 micromolar final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1.25 microliters of 6.29 micrograms/mL denatured luciferase solution containing 12 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 0.806 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase in Assay Buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 375 mM KCl) into all wells. After 3 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS were added to each well. Next, plates were incubated for 10 minutes and well luminescence was read on the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  Measurement of TR-FRET detection format artefact in the screen for agonists of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). This assay complements a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 631). Since the positive control agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) activity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-1/PPARgamma complex, a sample well that exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-1/PPARgamma assay most likely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to identify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may have an erroneous activity assignment in AID 631. This assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC1 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in a sample well measured immediately after addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with five ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 106 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 2 ug/mL anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC1 protein [aa 627-786].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000 Where, I671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617 nm. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation.  The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.  Any compound that exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible TR-FRET artefact.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones, but are also able to detect potential activators. In conjunction with assays against alpha-galactosidase (AID 1467), fluorogenic false positive compounds can be identified. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at 440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). In the AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. The purpose of this screen was to test confirmed primary hits from the M1 Antagonist Screen for their ability to dose-dependently elicit a response at the rat M4 receptor under assay conditions similar to the primary screen. 1. Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing M4 receptor and Gqi5 were plated at 25,000 cells/well in assay media (DMEM (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X Non-essential Amino Acids (NEAA), 1 mM Na pyruvate) in 384 well plates. 2. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3. Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 2.0 uM Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4. Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5. Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nm excitation and 540 nm emission filters 6. Test compound in assay buffer + 0.3 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds (compound add step) simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7. Subsequently, approximately 300 nM acetylcholine (EC80) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds (agonist stimulation step) and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8. 0.3% DMSO, compound vehicle, and an atropine concentration series ranging were added to each plate as controls for the compound add step. Additionally, assay buffer, 300 nM acetylcholine (EC80) and 1 uM acetylcholine (ECMAX) were added as controls at the time of agonist stimulation. 9. Test compounds were tested at 10 different concentrations resulting from 1 to 3 serial dilutions spanning the concentration range of 15 uM to 0.76 nM. Each compound concentration series was tested in triplicate. 1. Maximum fluorescence signal was selected from the time window ranging from 200 seconds to 210 seconds. 2.  The average fluorescence signal between 180 and 190 seconds was used as a baseline value. 3.  The 'value' for each well was determined as the difference of the max signal minus the average baseline. 4.  The values for each dose-response curve for each compound were treated as a group and fit to a variable-slope sigmoidal curve using Pipeline Pilot and the R-statistics package 'drc' module. 5.  Plate-based control statistics were calculated using Pipeline Pilot. 6.  Replicate group measurements for each compound were treated independently rather than averaged over the replicates. 7.  Individual curves were classified into a 'fit category' as either 'fit,' 'trend,' or 'no fit.' 'No fit' was used to describe groups where the curve fit did not converge. 'Fit' was used to describe groups where three or more actual data points lay on both sides of the calculated EC50. In cases where two or fewer data points were on either side of the EC50, the group was called a 'trend.'  This was done to acknowledge the increased uncertainty in curves where the calculated EC50 is less reliable. 8. The overall activity outcome is an aggregate of all successful fits. If a plurality of the replicates for a compound resulted in a fit or a trend, that compound was considered active. 9.  The activity score was assigned as 100 when 2 or 3 out of the 3 replicates were considered 'fit.' The score was assigned as 50 when 2 or 3 of 3 replicates were considered 'trend' or if one 'fit,' one 'trend,' and one 'no fit' existed for a set of replicates.  A score of 0 was assigned when fewer than 2 of 3 replicates gave either 'fit' or 'trend.'

Description:  The purpose of this cell-based reporter assay is to identify compounds that inhibit the expression of KLF5. This assay employs a human DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line that is stably transfected with a plasmid containing 2.0 kb of the human KLF5 promoter used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p). Cells are seeded in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for one day, followed by incubation with test compounds. Luciferase activity is monitored using a luminescent detection reagent, which contains the luciferase substrate D-luciferin that releases light energy upon conversion to oxyluciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and oxygen. As designed, compounds that inhibit KLF5 expression will reduce the activity of the KLF5 promoter, thereby reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and luciferase protein levels, resulting in decreased conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, and reduced well luminescence. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM. The DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum800 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 2500 cells in a 5 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above except without geneticin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or LY294002 (200 uM final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 27 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 1265). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862 and AID 1265; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 920); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition" (AID 1308); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 1317). In this assay STAT3 inhibition was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1.  Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The inhibitor and activator dose response assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (112 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final nominal EC80 concentration) was dispensed into all wells. The plates then were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. EGFR and EGFR mutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform.

In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To exclude the assay-related false positives, we used a biotinylated rabbit IgG to perform counter-screen. The biotinylated antibody mimics the phosphorylated ERK1/2 for bringing streptavidin coated beads and protein-A coated beads to a proximity range for the AlphaScreen detection. HEK293 cells stably expressing type-1 vasopressin receptor (V1b) were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium contained 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, non-essential amino acid, pyruvate and 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The aliquots of frozen cells were stored at -135C and used for the compound screening. All compounds were screened as titrations from 0.6 nM to 46 uM final concentration. Vasopressin was used to stimulate the ERK phosphorylation pathway. The ERK phosphorylation in cells was determined using an AlphaScreen assay kit provided by PerkinElmer. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (25 nM vasopressin). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. (1) Seed 4 ul/well of resuspended frozen HEK293 cells containing 2000 cells in white 1536-well plates for overnight with 1% FBS at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Description:  Calpains are ubiquitous, calcium-activated cysteine proteases involved in both physiological and pathological cellular functions. The two major forms, u-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain II), are activated by micromolar and millimolar calcium concentrations, respectively.  A current and well-supported hypothesis is that cellular injury leads to elevated intracellular calcium and provokes the pathologic activation of calpains. Activation of calpains is believed to be responsible for the cell death and axonal degeneration seen in many acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke, spinal cord and head injuries, and peripheral neuropathies.  Calpain activation leads to degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton, and inhibition of calpains prevents axonal degeneration. Despite the importance of calpains in the pathogenesis of axonal degeneration in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, calpains have not been subjected to a systematic small-molecule screen.  We have developed a fluorescent enzyme activity assay in 1536-well format to identify small molecule inhibitors of calpain II, the isoform most likely to be involved in axonal degeneration.  This dose response assay measures the calpain II-dependent hydrolysis of a self-quenching fluorescent calpain II peptide substrate.  Fluorescence intensity (ex. 360 nm and em. 490 nm) is detected with an EnVision plate reader and is proportional to calpain II activity.  Assay Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM cysteine, 5mM CaCl2, 1mM DTT) Purified calpain II (Calbiochem cat # 208715) Fluorogenic calpain II peptide substrate (Calbiochem cat# 208771) Positive control calpain II inhibitor (AK295 peptide, provided by assay PI) Assay Protocol: 1. Add 4 ul Assay Buffer to all wells. 2. Transfer appropriate amount of stock compounds to appropriate wells to reach testing concentration. 3. Add 1 ul of 1mM AK295 control compound to appropriate positive control wells. 4. Dispense 1 ul of ice cold calpain-2 (diluted 1:100 (42nM) in Assay Buffer). 5. Dispense 1 ul of Calpain Substrate III (reconstituted in 500 ul Assay Buffer (stock solution) then diluted 1:20 (15uM) in Assay Buffer). 6. Incubate reaction mixture for 30 minutes. 7. Read plate @ excitation of 360 nm and emission @ 490 nm. Data analysis - All data were normalized to plate controls using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  A 4 parameter logistic equation is fit to each compound using software from the R project for statistical analysis: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(conc/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom All of the fitted parameters are reported, as well as the relative IC50 (the point halfway between the fitted top and bottom of the curve). Compounds with an IC50 < 30 and Activity at IC50 < 60 were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of Active, and all others were assigned Inactive. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is calculated by normalizing the observed range of Active IC50s between 100 and 0, with the lowest IC50 corresponding to 100.  Compounds with an Inactive PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME were scored 0.

Description:  The assay is based on ability of Rhok2 to phosphorylate a specific peptide sequence derived from its substrate - ribosomal protein S6 (amino acid residues 229-239). Rhok2 uses ATP as a donor of phosphate for the phosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay kit (Kinase-Glo, Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Using this kit, residual amounts of ATP are measured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, through which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to produce luminescence. Luminescent signal is directly proportional to ATP concentration and inversely proportional to Rhok2 activity. The primary HTS campaign was conducted in 1536 well plate format. All compounds were tested once at a 6 micromolar final concentration.

Description:  Compound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. Previously, in a separate report under Pubchem submission ID 364, we describe a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign that was designed to measure the metabolic activity of a suspension cell line after challenge & 48 hours of incubation with test compound. For this primary HTS campaign the human T-cell line, Jurkat clone E6.1, was screened against the NIH set of 59,808 diverse compounds. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration. A luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for this assay[1]. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is not present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no luminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates with the presence of inviable cells. This campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive control. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately 100 nM. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. To select a practical number of compounds that exhibited high activity in the primary screen for follow-up assays, a cutoff value of the primary %inhibition was applied. The cutoff value was calculated as the sum of the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested and three times their standard deviation. In this case 765 unique compounds (1.3 % of all compounds screened) were selected as hits. A suspension of Jurkat cells (clone E6.1; ATCC Cat# TIB-152, Invitrogen Cat# K1045) in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, 5mM L Glutamine, and 1x antibiotic was prepared prior to assay. The concentration of cells in the suspension was 1 million/milliliter. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Then 20nL of test compound or control doxorubicin was added. Plates were lidded and incubated at 37 deg C at 5% CO2 for 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5 microliters / well of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Corp., Madison Wisconsin). After ten minutes of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the Viewlux Imaging UHTS reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median of the positive control doxorubicin at 4 micromolar final screening concentration.

Description:  In this assay inhibition of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that stably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce TNF-alpha-mediated induction of NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in NF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit NF-kB activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin and 1 ug/mL of puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The assay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received MG-132 (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, 95% RH. Next, 1 ul of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration resulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, the plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH. The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a dicistronic plasmid containing a viral internal ribosome entry site stem-loop sequence upstream of the 5'UTR stem-loop sequence from Prion protein (PRP) fused to the luciferase gene (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to non-specific RNA stem-loop binding. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]).  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep(Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation. Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform). In groups of 22, assay plates were delidded and stacked. They were then individually pinned with 100 nL compounds, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then moved in sets of 22 to room temperature and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then discarded.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M4/Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca. EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compound dose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for compounds with EC50 < 1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50 > 1uM. All other compounds were assigned as 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Project Overview: In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied RNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific regulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard genetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality. This screen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins required for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First, inhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding proteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function across nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent that specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.  The two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class tandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the germline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates posterior patterning and germline specification. Both proteins can be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro. Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate reader.  Expected Outcome: The ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to screen for inhibitors of this interaction.  Compounds inhibiting the interaction with show a dose-dependent reduction in the polarization value (in mP.) 7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844) in duplicate assay plates.  Predispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to two weeks.  For higher concentrations in dose retests, 15 or 30 nL was predispensed. MEX-5 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was prepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master mix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004% IPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser (Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  The target binding sequence TCR2 is a Temporal Control Region in the 3' untranslated region of the C. elegans gene glp-1 (abnormal Germ Line Proliferation).  Fluorescent TCR2 RNA (5'-UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA-FITC-3', Dharmacon / Thermo) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).  The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees for 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at room temperature.  The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light. Competing unlabeled TCR2 RNA (Dharmacon / Thermo) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25 uM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature. 1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr). The assay plates with predispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on the Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either 1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well of competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells). The final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were: 20 mM tris pH 8.0 40 mM NaCl 0.004% IPEGAL 100 uM zinc acetate 120 nM MEX5 protein 2 nM FITC labeled TCR2 RNA 4 ug/mL tRNA type X 10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO For positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled TCR2 RNA Plates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute. One hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer) with a G factor of 1.  Total fluorescence from the P and S polarization channels was recorded along with the Fluorescence Polarization calculation.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The assay described here is a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases are simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library.  The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a well.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab2 there are only 69 missing compounds.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5mM stock diluted to 50uM in water. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Naloxone was added to column 1 and 24.  Naloxone final concentration was 1uM.   d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Damgo was added to the entire plate, except column 23. Damgo final concentration was 5uM. Plates were then incubated for another 45 minutes. 7) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  8) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 9) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 10) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 11) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.

Description:  Late stage results from the probe development effort to identify antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2). NPY Y2 Inhibition Assays (Assays 1 and 2): The purpose of these assays is to determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit NPY-Y2.  A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration.  Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 2.8 micromolar (Assay 1) or in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar (Assay 2). NPY-Y1 Inhibition Counterscreen Assays (Assays 3 and 4): The purpose of these assays is to determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit NPY-Y1.  A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 3.5 micromolar (Assay 3) or in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar (Assay 4). Cytotoxicity Assay (Assay 5): The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds of interest reduce cell viability.  Y2R HEK293-CNG cells were seeded at 500 cells per well in 1536-well plates in 5 uL growth media. Compounds (in DMSO) were prepared as 10-point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at 11 uM final concentration were added to cells. Plates were incubated for 24, 48 or 72 h at 37 C.  After incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) were added to each well and the plates were allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature.  Luminescence was then measured (ViewLux plate reader, PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). Viability was measured as a percentage relative to control cells treated with DMSO alone (0% cytotoxicity) and cells treated with 100 uM Doxorubicin (100% cytotoxicity). Brain Penetrance Assays (Assay 6): Plasma and brain levels of the compounds were assessed in C57Bl6 mice 30 minutes after dosing 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Samples were formulated at 2 mg/mL in 10/10/80 DMSO/tween/water. Blood was collected into EDTA containing tubes at 30 min and plasma was generated using standard centrifugation techniques. Brain samples were frozen upon collection and all samples were stored at -80 C until analyzed. Brain tissue was not perfused prior to freezing to prevent diffusion of the compound out of the tissue during the process. Plasma samples were analyzed by treating 25 &#956;L of plasma with 125 &#956;L of acetonitrile containing an internal standard (propanolol) and filtering through a Millipore Multiscreen Solvinter 0.45 &#956;m low binding PTFE hydrophilic filter. The filtrate was analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an API Sciex 4000. MRM methods were developed in positive ion mode and concentrations were determined using a standard curve between 2 to 2000 ng/mL. Samples with concentrations outside of the curve were diluted with blank plasma and reanalyzed. Similar conditions were used to determine brain levels except the samples were weighed and acetonitrile was added (10x, weight by volume). The samples were sonicated to extract the compound from the brain matrix and then filtered as described above. A density of 1 g/mL was used to convert compound per mg tissue into molar equivalents.

Description:  Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by mutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this pathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single gene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer the LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable overlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within each type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2 (Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5 yrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. CDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of Man-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is not effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI reaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia) will benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic flux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a non-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting.  The purpose of this assay is to identify non-competititve inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its product, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with NADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. This assay is performed in the presence of 10x-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate, mannose-6-phosphate, to help to ensure the identification of non-competitive inhibitors. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "HTS identification of compounds inhibiting phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) via a fluorescence intensity assay using a high concentration of mannose 6-phosphate" (AID 1220) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. PMI assay materials: 1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.0 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml Diaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin. 3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6 ug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. PMI Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate (cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix) 2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) 3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4) 2 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 5) 9 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 6) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 7) The plates were read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices), Ex544, Em590. 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).

Description:  The assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which was modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens.  The fTHP is labeled with both a fluorophore (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) and quencher 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in liberation of the fluorescent Mca moiety. In this assay, the fluorescence signal from liberated Mca is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. The primary HTS campaign was conducted in 1536 well plate format. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration. This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences) and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2). After 4 hours of incubation, 5 microliters of 50 millimolar EDTA was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes and fluorescence was read on Perkin-Elmer Viewlux for 1 second. Prior to inhibition calculations, basal signal (i.e. signal from wells containing all reagents minus inhibitor) was subtracted from test compound and control well values. To calculate percent inhibition, the test compound well signal was divided by the median signal from the 100 percent inhibition control (i.e. wells containing MMP-13 inhibitor) and multiplied by 100.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all wells in the sample field of control plate devoid of test or control compounds, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. This assay was found to be prone to fluorescent artifacts due to short excitation wavelength of the fluorophore (Mca). Compounds that appeared to be fluorescent artifact were labeled as "possible fluorescent artifact" in the data submitted to PubChem. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR.  The assay was performed in a #duplex# format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. The FPR primary HTS assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPR.  The FPRL1 primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well).  After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).   fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide.  The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. Test compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as: %Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)] in which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells containing test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of cells in negative control wells, respectively. Activity Scoring Test compounds resulting in a mean inhibition of greater than 30% were considered active.  The activity scores of the active compounds were calculated as: Activity Score = 100 x (%Inhibition - %Inhib_Min) /  (%Inhib_Max - %Inhib_Min) in which %Inhib_Min and %Inhib_Max were 30 and 100, respectively.  The calculated number was rounded up to the next higher integer value to obtain the final reported score. An activity score of 0 was assigned to all compounds with %Inhibition of 30 or less.

Description:  Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin and Geneticin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed per test well of a 1536-well plate (2000 cells/well), followed by incubation at 25 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour.  After this incubation, 21 nL of test compound in DMSO (4 uM final nominal concentration; 0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of 2% BSA (low control wells; in PBS) or galanin (1-16) peptide (high control wells; 150 nM final nominal concentration in 2% BSA; EC80) was dispensed to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of 2% BSA was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours, followed by addition of 1 ul/well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at 25 degrees C, well fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only.  To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 1 microliter of 2% BSA in PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 1 microliter of 4.5 micromolar galanin (1-16) in 2% BSA A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score 0.

Description:  Novel reagents that inhibit the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation and subsequently the Amyloid beta protein production, that is elevated in Alzheimer's disease, could lead to the discovery of therapeutic drugs for the disease. MLSMR 160K library was screened for small molecules that suppress the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation by binding to the 5'Untranslated Region of the APP mRNA. It utilizes a stable neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y transfectants that express Luciferase under the translational control of 146 nucleotides from the 5'UTR of APP mRNA. It had been shown that this region forms a stem loop which is, in turn, a significant regulator of the APP levels in the brain (1, 2). The effects of compounds addition on APP levels is measured by quantification of luciferase expression levels with a bioluminescence assay system. The assay was previously utilized by Jack Rogers for HTS screen of a 110,000 compounds library from the Laboratory for Drug Discovery on Neurodegeneration (LDDN)(3). Materials - Dulbeco Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4.5g/lglucose, without glutamine     (LONZA,#12-614Q) - Phenol red free Dulbeco Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4.5g/lglucose, without glutamine (LONZA,#12-917) - L-Glutamine (Invitrogen #25030-81) - Penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen #15140-122) - Geneticin (Invitrogen #10131-035) - Trypsin (Hyclone (SH30206.02) - Fetal Bovine serum (Invitrogen, #16000) - Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), tablets, w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+ (MP Biochemicals, #2810305) - Cycloheximide (Sigma, # C-7698) - Compound plates (2mM in 100% DMSO) - DMSO (SIGMA, 154938-1l) - Steady-Glo luciferase Assay System (Promega, #E2550) - 384-well Assay plates White (greiner bio-one #781080) Protocol 1. Cell Culture - pIRES(APP mRNA 5'UTR) stable transfected SH-SY5Y cells as well as the SH-SY5Y control cells were obtained from Jack T. Rogers as frozen stocks. - The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 4mM glutamine, and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin. The transfected SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in the same medium that was supplemented with 300ug/ml of geneticin. - To passage cells, the monolayer was washed first with PBS (25 ml) per T175 and the cells detached by incubation with 5ml trypsin/EDTA solution for 6 mn. - Cells were resuspended after the addition of 5 ml growth medium to the T175, transferred to conical 15ml tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 x g - The transfected cells were seeded at dilutions of 1:4. The control SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a dilution of 1:10 or 1:20 and grown until they reached confluency. 2. Cell Seeding for HTS was performed using an 8-channel multi-drop (MTX labs). - Seed 2,000 cells (transfected cells) in 50 ul of media per well of 384-well plate in rows 1 to 23. - Seed 2,000 cells (SHSY-5Y control) in 50 ul of media per well of 384-well plate in row 24 - Incubate overnight (15 h) at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity before addition of compound. 3.

Description:  A number of solution-based assays are available for quantifying the amount of aggregated protein, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, sedimentation, and static and laser light scattering.  However, none of these methods allows direct visualization of filaments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can complement these solution-based assays by providing information on filament morphology and length distributions.  In vitro fibrillization of htau40 was performed in the presence or absence of selected compounds.  The resultant filaments were detected after absorption onto formvar and carbon coated grids and examined by TEM.  Random digital images of each experimental condition were obtained, imported into imaging software, and quantified for filament length and number. Aggregation of His6-htau40 (5 uM final concentration) in assembly buffer was induced with arachidonic acid (50 uM final concentration) in the presence or absence of selected library compounds. Each compound was tested at IC50 and four times the IC50values as determined by the tau ThS binding assay. After incubation (18 h at 37 degrees Celsius), reactions were diluted 5-fold in distilled water and assayed by transmission electron microscopy as described previously.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause an increase in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07  1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  Dose response counterscreen assay for neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1040).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 1040;  2) they confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)" (AID 1254); and 3) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism" (AID 1255). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 uM. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY at its EC95 (8 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of either test compound, High Control (BIIE0246, 0.28 micromolar final nominal concentration) or Low Control (DMSO, 0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T45 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge High_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Anesthetic development has remained a largely empirical process. There are growing concerns about the cognitive effects of known general anesthetics [1] and acceleration of the onset of neurodegenerative disease [2].  The compounds' toxicity [3] and multiple specific binding targets in the mammalian brain [4] has made them less attractive as drug leads.  In this assay, a GABAergic mimetic model system, apoferritin and a profluorescent 1-aminoanthracene ligand (1-AMA), was used to construct a competitive binding assay for identification of novel general anesthetics.  The assay was validated for 1-AMA using other known anesthetics, such as isoflurane (CID:3763) and propofol (CID: 4943) Three uL of reagents (free 1-AMA (50% saturated solution of 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 3, 4 as negative control and 1-AMA/apoferritin mixture (10 uM horse-spleen apoferritin in 50% saturated 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 1, 2, 5-48) was  dispensed into 1536-well Greiner black assay plates.  Compounds (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys pintool equipped with 1,536-pin array (10 nL slotted pins, V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA). Titration of the positive control, propofol, were delivered via pin transfer from separate control plates to the 2nd column of each assay plate.  The starting concentration of the control, dissolved in DMSO, was at 160 mM, followed by two-fold dilution points in duplicate, for a total of 16 concentrations.  The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on an EnVision HTS multilabel reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) (end point read, 3 min/plate) using Fura2 BFP excitation filter (380 nm, bandwidth 10 nm) and fluorescein emission filter (535 nm, bandwidth 25 nm) set.  A LANCE/DELFIA dichroic mirror with a cutoff wavelength at 400 nm was used to maximize signal accuracy and strength. Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column 5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in order to monitor for and record any shifts in the background. Activity was computed as the normalized fluorescence response relative to free 1-AMA and 1-AMA/apoferritin complex values. A four parameter Hill equation was fitted to the concentration-response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and observed responses.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. One of the many down stream effectors in G protein signaling pathway is the cell surface intergrin alpha1beta4 (Very Late Antigen-4, VLA4). The stimulation of formyl peptide receptor (FPR, a GPCR) will subsequently activate the VLA4 signaling pathway. Upon activation, VLA4 binds to the specific ligand LDV peptide in a high affinity state with a KD of ~0.2 nanoM rather than 12 nanoM at resting state. This process can be monitored by the fluorescent signal from FITC conjugated LDV peptide. When cells express the non-desensitizing mutant of FPR (FPRdeltaST), the duration of VLA4 activation will largely depend on the length of G protein activation. Human monocyte U937 cells that are a natural host of VLA4 and many RGS proteins and stably transfected with FPRdeltaST have been used to monitor VLA-4 affinity changes in live cell assays. We adapted this system as a cell-based secondary assay to identify potential small molecule RGS/G protein inhibitor candidates revealed in the bead-based multiplexing screen. Inhibitors of the RGS-Galpha interaction have the effect of elongating Galpha signaling; the Galpha signaling pathway can remain #on# for longer periods once activated. Under normal conditions, FPR activation should lead to rapid signal increase followed by return to baseline within 100 seconds after activation. In the presence of an RGS-Galpha inhibitor, VLA4 response time should increase. Although the detection signal in this assay reflects the distal end of the signaling pathway, this novel assay can be used as an indicator of possible cell membrane permeable inhibitors that block RGS-Galpha interactions. Once confirmed, the reversibility and toxicity of the identified compound(s) family will be further evaluated, followed by optimizing probe molecules that regulate RGS protein function in a cellular context.     This assay is an assessment of cell permeability of compounds acting as RGS inhibitors. 500 microL of U937 cells at 1 million cells per microL in RPMI1640 media expressing a non-desentizied mutant of Formyl Peptide Receptor, DeltaST, and a mini magnetic stir bar are added to a FACs tube.  The cells are kept at 37 degrees C under mild stirring at all times. Fluorescence intensity of the cells is collected from the FL1 channel of a BD FACScan Flow cytometer equipped with a 530/30nm bandpath filter. After recording cell autofluorescence for 20sec, 0.5 microL of 4 microM (or 8 microM) LDVFITC is added to the cells. LDV peptide is the specific binding partner of cell surface integrin Alpha4Beta1 (VLA4) with a KD of 12nanoM at the low affinity state of VLA4 and 0.2 nanoM at the high affinity state [Chigaev, et. al, 2001]. The cells are incubated with LDVFITC for 70 sec in order to reach the equilibrium and then activated with either 10 nanoM of fMLF or 10 microM of test compound for an additional 270 sec. Calculations: Due to the temporal nature of this assay, we utilized the area under the curve for assessing differences induced by the RGS hit compounds compared with DMSO. First the background fluorescence measured with 4 nanoM LDVFITC was subtracted from all the data points. Then the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated via the trapezoidal rule from the data collected after the addition of fMLF; AUC = Sum [(time2 - time1)x 0.5 x (MCF2 + MCF2)] where MCF1 is the Mean Channel Fluorescence in FL1 measured at time equal to time1, and MCF2 is the Mean Channel Fluorescence measured at time equal to time2. The comparison between the effect of the compound and DMSO was calculated by ratio of the respective AUCs: Response = 100 x |(AUC_Cmpd/AUC_DMSO) -1| where AUC_Cmpd is the area under the curve in the presence of tester compound and AUC_DMSO is the area under the curve in the presense of carrier, DMSO.  The AUC_DMSO for this experiment was 20093 MCF-sec.  The Response value is the same as the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE. An active compound have a Response greater than or equal to 25. Annotations of interference of the assay due to innate fluorescence of the compound was made in the column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT. For most of these fluorescent compound, the binding data for LDVFITC were quenched, therefore not yielding any productive data.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. This assay is a follow-up to "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ receptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2521 and Single concentration confirmation of uHTS hits from a small molecule antagonists of the APJ  receptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay A.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1510), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1524), were nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit S1P1 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 24 and active compounds range of activity score is 24 to 100.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line which is established from NIH Swiss mouse embryo. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the NIH 3T3 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. Membranes were prepared from M5-CHO cells according to a previously described protocol. Binding reactions contained 0.09 nM [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) (obtained commercially from Amersham), 15-20 ug of membrane protein, and test compound or atropine in a total volume of 500 ul assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). 1 uM (final) atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.264 nM.  Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (750 rpm).  Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  True [3H]-NMS concentration was back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS used in the reaction.  Atropine Ki determined to be 0.21 by Cheng-Prusoff equation.  For all assays, radioligand depletion was kept to approximately 10% or less. The compound did not compete with[3H]-NMS and was inactive in this assay. The 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and the 'Score' was assigned as '0'.

Description:  BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions.  Small molecule BAP1 inhibitors were identified using a kinetic, high-throughput BAP1 activity assay (AID 436).  In this assay, ubiquitin conjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC) was used as a BAP1 substrate. Hydrolysis of UbAMC by BAP1 results in the release of free AMC and an increase in fluorescence.  The reaction velocity is measured as the increase in fluorescence over time and is proportional to BAP1 activity.  Compounds identified in the initial single-dose screen have been confirmed in dose response using the same assay format.  To date, UbAMC is the only substrate commercially available for in vitro DUB activity assays. However, the excitation/emission wavelengths of AMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm) overlap with those of many small molecules, which leads to a high percentage of fluorescence artifacts.  To overcome the problem of interference by compound autofluorescence, we replaced UbAMC with ubiquitin-rhodamine(110)-glycine (UbRHO).  The excitiation/emission wavelegths of RHO (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm) are right-shifted compared to those of AMC and therefore has less overlap with autofluorescent compounds.  RHO also generates a much stronger fluorescent signal, which greatly increases assay sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio, and allows for the use of less substrate. To test selectivity for BAP1, hit compounds were also tested in parallel against UCH-L1, a closely related DUB in the UCH family.  Selectivity data for selected compounds are also presented in this assay.  Analogs of hits identified in the BAP1 primary screen (AID 436) were tested in this assay.  Each compound was tested at 8-11 concentrations in 1:2 serial dilutions from the highest concentration (50-100 micromolar). Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  Procedure: 1. Dilute BAP1 (provided by assay PI), L1 (Boston Biochem cat# E-340), and UbRHO (provided by assay PI) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 25-100 mM NaCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT). Keep on ice and protect UbRHO from light. 2. Add 12.5 ul of BAP1 or L1 (5 nM final) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls. 3. Transfer 0.5 uL compounds to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations. 4. Add 12.5 ul 50-100 nM UbRHO (50 nM final for BAP1, 25-50 nM final for L1) 5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using kinetic settings.  The plate was read every 1 minute 45 seconds for 10 readings using a 505 nm dichroic mirror (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm). 6. All compounds were tested in triplicate Data analysis: Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. The velocity was calculated using the slope from a linear fit of the individual readings. Where appropriate, data points recorded at times beyond the linear range of reaction were omitted from velocity determination. The average velocity of the blank wells for the plate was subtracted from each compound velocity. The blank-subtracted values were then normalized to the negative controls to arrive at the average Percentage of Control for each concentration.  BAP1 selectivity is represented as the as the ratio of BAP1 and L1 IC50 values (i.e. the higher the ratio, the more selective for BAP1). For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using software from the R Project for Statistical Computing. This assay was used to evaluate the relative potency (IC50) and selectivity of active compounds as BAP1 inhibitors.  All compounds were marked as active, and all compounds given an activity score of 100.

Description:  Mineralization of cartilage and bone occurs by a series of physicochemical and biochemical processes that together facilitate the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) in specific areas of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Experimental evidence has pointed to the presence of HA crystals along collagen fibrils in the ECM and also within the lumen of chondroblast- and osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs). Dr.  Milan's  working model is that bone mineralization is first initiated within the lumen of MVs. In a second step, HA crystals grow beyond the confines of the MVs and become exposed to the extracellular milieu where they continue to propagate along collagen fibrils. Recent data have indicated that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role in restricting the concentration of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP), a mineralization inhibitor, to maintain a P/PPi ratio permissive for normal bone mineralization. Using a variety of single and double gene knockout experiments it has been found that mice deficient in TNAP function, i.e., Akp2-/- mice, display osteomalacia due to an arrest in the propagation of HA crystals outside the MVs caused by an increase in extracellular PPi concentrations. Inside the MVs, however, HA crystals are still present in Akp2-/- mice. It is hypothesize that a newly identified soluble phosphatase, PHOSPHO1, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphoserine (PS) present in the MVs, is responsible for increasing the local concentration of Pi inside the MVs to change the P/PPi ratio to favor precipitation of HA seed crystals. This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate phosphate from phosphoethanolamine and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS absorbance assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit PHOSPHO1" (AID 1565) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. 1) POSPHO1 was obtained from the assay provider's laboratory. 2) Assay Buffer: 20mM MES-NaOH pH 6.7, 2mM MgCl2, 0.0125% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA Procedure 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.   2 uL of compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22 of Greiner 384-well white small-volume plates (784075). Each curve was performed in duplicate. 2) Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of NC and PC solutions, respectively. For the following additions, using the Multidrop sterilizing the tubing with copious amounts of water and 70% EtOH before and after each reagent. 3) Add 9 uL of buffer to columns 1-2. 4) Add 9 uL PHOSPHO1 intermediate solution to columns 3-24. 5) Add 9 uL of PEA intermediate solution to the entire plate (columns 1-24). 6) Spin plate down to maintain an even level of volume. 7) Incubate plate at room temperature for 1 hr (covered). 8) Add 20 uL of Biomol Green to the entire plate (columns 1-24). 9) Spin plate down to maintain an even level of volume. 10) Incubate plate for 30 mins to allow Biomol signal to develop. 11) Read plate on a Perkin Elmer Viewlux at 630nm in absorbance mode

Description:  Counterscreen for vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 2797) and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435), are nonselective V1R agonists due to activation of the related GPCR, OXTR. In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 23 hours. Next, uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. The average percent activation and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen (AID 2435) was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. % Activation values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-2, for inactive 2-0.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. Recent interest in cathepsin L has been generated by research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the SARS and Ebola viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin L inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that appear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion. A high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors was designed as an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Primary HTS results and dose-response confirmation in the presence of DTT and cysteine have been reported previously (AIDs 460 and 825). A compound with picomolar activity against cathepsin L was isolated, resynthesized, and the kinetics of inhibition were determined Human liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM cysteine. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1. Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2. Fill Corning low-volume 384-well black plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4. Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205. (Four parameter logistic fit; maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively; Hill slope limited to > -0.1.)

Description:     To further establish activity of potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) as inhibitors of estrogen signaling, we have assayed these compounds in cell-based cotransfection reporter gene assays of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription.  A human endometrial cancer cell line (HEC-1) that expresses nuclear receptor coactivators but contains no endogenous ER alpha was transfected with a full-length ER alpha expression vector, an estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene plasmid (2ERE Luc), and pCMV beta-galactosidase (beta-gal; internal control).  The transfected cells were incubated with two different concentrations of estradiol (E2) and increasing concentrations of CBI; luciferase activity was then measured.  If the compound acts by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism - that is, by directly competing with the SRCs - then a change in the concentration of E2 should have no effect on the IC50 of the compound.  We see no change in compound IC50 in the presence of either 1 nM or 100 nM E2, indicating that the inhibition of transcription is, in fact, occurring by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism. An internal beta-galactosidase control suggests that the cells are viable at all concentrations of the CBIs, verifying that the effect of the CBIs is not due to general cell toxicity. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 629 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha Coactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay. Human endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1) were maintained in culture as described and transfected in 24 well plates.  A mixture of HBSS (50 uL/well), Holo-transferrin (Sigma T1408) (20 uL/well), and lipofectin (Invitrogen #18292-011) (5 uL/well) were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The DNA mixture was made by adding 200 ng of pCMV alpha-galactosidase as internal control, 500 ng of the estrogen responsive reporter gene plasmid 2ERE Luc, and 100 ng of full-length ER-beta; expression vector with 75 uL HBSS per well and allowed to incubate after addition of the first mixture for 20 minutes at room temperature. The cell media was changed to Opti-MEM (350 uL/well) and 150 uL of the transfection mixture was added to each well.  The cells were incubated at 37 deg C in a 5% CO2 containing incubator for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 5% charcoal-dextran-treated calf serum and the desired concentrations of ligands. Reporter gene activity was assayed at 24 h after ligand addition. Luciferase activity, normalized for the internal control &#946;-galactosidase activity, was assayed as described. In the initial screen, antagonist activity is determined at four concentrations of compound increasing to 10 &#956;M, in the presence of 10-9 M E2.    The EC50, where one could be determined, is reported under 1nM E2 conditions. If an EC50 could be determined, the Activity Outcome is set to Active, and the Activity Score is set to 100.  In other cases, the Activity Outcome is set to Inactive, and Activity Score is set to 0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1 (CHRM1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1; M1). In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 are loaded, intracellularly with the calcium indicator dye, Fluo-8, followed by treatment with agonist control or test compounds. As designed, compounds that act as CHRM1 agonists will increase intracellular calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye and well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-hM1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay for potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2445), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay to identify potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 434985). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds and agonist. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR potentiators will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. Following a pre-incubation of 6 minutes at room temperature, 15 nL of oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration, EC100) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) and test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC100) and DMSO. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic panel (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5) for their ability to modulate calcium flux. Experimental Protocol: Stable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing rat M1, human M2-Gqi5, human M3, rat M4-Gqi5, or human M5 were plated into 96-well Costar optical bottom assay plates at a concentration of 50K cells/well in 100 microliters of Ham's F-12 media.   Cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C (5% CO2). The following day, medium was removed from cells and they were incubated in 50 microliters of Fluo-4 AM diluted in assay buffer (HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) for 1 hour at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 45 microliters of assay buffer.  Test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO-matched assay buffer at 2X concentration and 45 microliters was applied to a cell-containing assay plate in an automated format using the Flexstation (Molecular Devices).  Calcium flux was measured over time as an increase in fluorescence (fold over basal), and the max minus min values for each well were copied into a custom excel template, which normalized the data as a % of maximum response elicited by a high concentration of ACh control. This data was then copied into Prism (version 4.0c), which fit the data to a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable slopes using no constraints or weighting.

Description:  A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 activation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators would increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely proportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1 agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar SEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. In addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also determined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the parental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications. For the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay except test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the parental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the #potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM forskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For the agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the parental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. For these dose response assays, one of two cell lines was used. The S1P-1 "potentiator" and agonist assays used a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P1 receptor (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct. The "parental" counter screen dose response assay used a CHO Cre Bla cell line (Invitrogen part#K1129). All cells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks (part#431080) at 37 degrees C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco#s Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone part#SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen part#1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen part#11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen part#15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen part#25030-081), and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen part#15140-122).For the parental cell line no selection antibiotic was used but for the S1P1 transformed cells 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen part#10131-027) was used. Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco#s Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and SEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar (forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871 was also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e. its EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma part#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting #background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:  Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man, annually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. Glucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite, the bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that HK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is lethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been unsuccessful. Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have been developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. T. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome 10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical. TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian HKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and human HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets. Indeed, it has been suggested that the possibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long sought-after inhibitors a possibility. Thus, a simple "mix and read" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the enzyme.  Assay protocol used as developed for the original High Throughput Screening campaign The basic procedure for the TbHK1 HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture components as follows: 1     15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound concentration 10 uM). 2     15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of 0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively. 3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL). 4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. 5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). 6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH        in the reaction mixture.

Description:  The assay was designed to pre-treat MRP-1 overexpressing human H69AR lung tumor cells with library of approximately 10,000 compounds, each tested in duplicate, for 18-22 hours at a final concentration of 10 micromolar prior to the addition of a toxic dose of doxorubicin (IC80 = 25 uM), a known MRP-1 substrate. Following 72 hours of combined treatment, viable cell number was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of vehicle treated cells which served as positive controls, and 32 replicates treated with doxorubicin (25 micromolar), which served as negative controls.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha); Neubig and Siderovski, 2002]. Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS19 that value had been determined to be 107 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to confirm mutant JAK2V617F inhibition activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (PubChem AID 1446), and inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for inhibitors of mutant JAK2V617F: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of parental Ba/F3 cell viability" (PubChem AID 1486). This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is cytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell viability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.6 uM. The BaF3 EpoR-JAK2V617F cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented as above. The assay was started by dispensing 5 ul of cell suspension to each well. Next, 28 nL of test compound (5.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.56 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (5.6 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 5 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  Signal transduction pathways mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major therapeutic targets with many known pharmacologic modulators. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are a key family of modulators and scaffolds for GPCRs which have been identified by many authors as appealing drug targets [1-5]. RGS proteins bind to activated G proteins and strongly inhibit their signals by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP [6-7]. Consistent with this mode of action, genetic deletion of RGS greatly enhances receptor signaling [8-10]. Furthermore, RGS proteins display isoform-specific tissue distribution [11-14] and their expression is altered in pathophysiological states including Parkinson's disease [15], neuropathic pain [16-17], schizophrenia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure [18]. An activator of RGS action would be expected to suppress the function of GPCR agonists such as vasoactivators, inflammatory mediators, endogenous neurotransmitters, or catecholamines such as L-DOPA. It has recently been established that loss of function of RGS2 causes hypertensive symptoms in mice [19] and may contribute to vasoactive disorders in humans as well [20-22]. Also, reduced expression of RGS4 has been correlated with schizophrenia [23-24]. Consequently, compounds that could either enhance the function of RGS proteins or could increase their expression might be of therapeutic benefit. The identification of selective modulators of RGS proteins would also greatly facilitate experimental studies of this sizeable protein family (with 20-30 members) by permitting rapid and specific chemical potentiation. Such RGS modulators would be particularly useful to determine which RGS proteins modulate particular receptor signaling pathways. The goal of this project is to identify potentiators /activators of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), using a receptor-stimulated cell-based Ca++ assay. To screen for compounds that activate the RGS4 protein, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses M3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that do not show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered as activator/potentiator hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor activators/potentiators will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells. Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10%FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15ug/ml Blasticidin, 400ug/ml G418, 200ug/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11.  After 100 seconds, add 4 ul of ECmax (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [26] 14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12 15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is less than 4 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B score Activator Ratio<mean-4*SD), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation plus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an activator of RGS4.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay was run to characterize initial structure activity relationships. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine (Eu3+-AB) and the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). FP Assay Reagents: 1.

Description:  Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit HCV NS3 helicase activity. In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide molecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5' fluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to a second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon strand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon strand forms an intramolecular hairpin that brings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules into juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity at 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin formation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and quencher, thus preventing quenching of well fluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also performed to identify compounds that quench and enhance Cy5 fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 10.9 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 ul of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM Tween20, 6 ug/mL BSA) containing 13.89 nM NS3 helicase fragment and 5.56 nM NS3 substrate were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, thioflavine S (110 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1 ul of 5 mM ATP into all wells. Well fluorescence was read after 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to inhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60 (RFU_t60), named Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows: Ratio_RFU = RFU_t60/RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (test_compound_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)/(positive_control_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 32 and active compounds range of activity score is 32 to 100.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-020) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the MRC-5 cell line which is derived from human normal lung fibroblasts. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the MRC-5 line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and staurosporine were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Cultured human H69AR lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds from the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository for 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 micromolar in the absence or presence of doxorubicin at a concentration of 2 micromolar. Following treatment, the level of ATP, which is indicative of viable cell number, was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence.  Each plate contained 24 replicates of carrier treated cells which served as a negative control, 16 replicates for 25 micromolar sulindac sulfide which served as a positive control for reversing resistance to doxorubicin, and 24 replicates for 6-methyl purine riboside (1 micrograms/ml), which served as a positive control for cytotoxicity.

Description:  Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor HEK 293 cells stably expressing the TSHR as well as a modified CNG were purchased from BD biosciences. Stimulation of cAMP production causes the CNG to open and subsequent membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent membrane potential dye (BD biosciences) was utilized to detect cAMP stimulation in TSHR cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 250 ug/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1 ug/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen) at 37C in 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells expressing CNG but without TSHR (parental cells) were used in concert to control for compounds signaling through endogenous receptors and targets of HEK 293 cells. High Throughput Screening. Freshly passaged cells (TSHR or parental) were dispensed into 1536-well assay plates at 4 ul/well in DMEM containing phenol red (Invitrogen), 10% FCS (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 20 to 36 hrs before the robotic screening. The screen was initiated by addition of 4 ul/well membrane potential dye containing 100 uM RO 20-1724 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 60 min incubation at room temperature to allow for dye equilibration across the cell membrane. 23 nl/well compound or control was then added to the assay plates, which were incubated for additional 30 min before reading a Envision fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in bottom-read mode for fluorescence intensity (emission at 590 nm).

Description:  A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human 5HT1a receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-15 pathway coupling protein was used (Invitrogen, part K1083). Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 3 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 50ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.625 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 2% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Immediately after, 50 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. Then, 1ul of 5-CT agonist challenge was added to test wells and negative control wells to a final concentration of 100 nanomolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting ""background"" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the negative control signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition= ((test_compound- median_negative_control)/( median_positive_control - median_negative_control))*100 The negative control wells were treated with challenge only (EC80 5-CT) and the positive controls wells were treated with the IC100 of WAY-100635 (50 nanomolar) in the presence of 5-CT challenge. The percent inhibition for each well has been calculated as follows: %inhibition = (test_compound - median_ negative_control)/(median_positive_control - median_negative_control)*100 where the positive control is Y-27632 (13 micromolar) and negative control is DMSO only.

Description:  The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells, respectively.  The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ.  The gene products are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica.  During the past year Dr. Harris' group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi.  They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as PhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing verses inducing conditions for each of the promoters.  This allowed for the development of a primary screening and counterscreening assays for PhoP-specific inhibitors which may lead to the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection. The inhibition eukaryotic cell culture growth was established using THP1 cells (ATCC Cat. # TIB-202), a Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. This counter-screening assay for eukaryotic culture growth inhibition was performed after the main confirmatory (dose-response) assay.  This counterscreen assay was cell-based in 384-well plate format and tested the cytotoxicity of compounds only, without the addition of bacteria. This assay was conducted with all 2302 screened in the confirmation and counterscreens.  Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown and incubated with compounds in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS, for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal. Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  Cell viability was calculated relative to the mean of the cell control. Viability at each of 10 tested concentrations ranging from 50 uM to 0.1 uM. Compounds that showed cell viability < 80% were considered Active (or Toxic). EC50 values were calculated only for active compounds using a 4 parameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm, with the maximum and minimum locked at 0 and 100 respectively.

Description:  Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) are important human and/or animal pathogens that cause acute virus infections with severe diseases and/or death. Several recent human and/or animal epidemics have been caused by arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DNV) in South America and Asia, West Nile virus (WNV) in North America and Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe.  Commercially available vaccines are not available for many arboviruses and those that are available are frequently not 100% efficacious.  For example, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against WNV, which is spreading across the US.  The commercial Dengue vaccine has been under development for decades and still is not effective against all strains of Dengue viruses.  This was recently seen when a new strain of Dengue III spread through South America causing sever disease and death.  So for many arbovirus based diseases, there is no effective vaccine or chemotherapy currently available.  The need to develop antiviral drugs is critical in treating and managing disease.  BTV was selected as a prototype virus from this genus for use in developing a High Throughput Screening protocol.  It was selected because it is not pathogenic in humans, which reduces the risk associated with assay development using infectious agents.  To screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format.  The assay measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in BSR cells by BTV infection using cell viability as the end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by BTV infection involves challenging 5000 cells with BTV virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared on July 10, 2007 from BSR cells. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 72 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Cell viability was determined from intracellular ATP concentration using firefly luciferase as the reporter. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. Cell Culture: BSR cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. The cells are maintained at 37OC, 5.0% CO2 to 90% confluence. Prior to cell plating, cells were re-suspended in DMEM with 100ug/L streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L, 4mM L-glut and 1% FBS (Assay Media). BTV virus culture: The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared in BSR cells using a stock available in Dr. Qianjun Li's laboratory. Briefly, BSR cells were grown in four T75 plates to 90% confluence, and 5ml of BTV-10 virus at 105pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. After three days incubation, cells and the supernatant were harvested and the cells were pelleted.  The cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80 OC. These virus stocks were titrated in BSR cells using the TCID50 method. The titer was 1 X 108 TCID50/ml. Control and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and 5ul was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates.  Test compounds were diluted in media to 60uM with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%.  5ul was also dispensed to the assay plate.   Cell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 5000 cells/well were plated in 15uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were then transferred to the Virology HTS lab and incubated 2-4 hrs at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity. Virus Addition: BTV was diluted in media to 5,000 pfu/ml and 10ul was added to the compound wells and the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.01).  Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell control wells.  All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for 72 h within the BSL-2 laboratory. Endpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well.  Plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-2 facility.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 5 (S1P5). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as antagonists of S1P5. This assay uses Tango S1P5-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 8 (EDG8; S1P5) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P5 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P5 antagonists will inhibit S1P5 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-61, for inactive 55-0.

Description:  Dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1040).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria:  1) they were active in AID 1040; 2) they confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1254); and 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism." (PubChem AID 1255). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism.  As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units.  Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates.  Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (10 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T45 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Assessement of equilibrium binding of guanine nucleotide to the guanine nucleotide binding protein can be utilized to evaluate if a inhibitory compound is acting at the binding site of guanine nucleotide or at an alternative, allosteric site. A direct competitive inhibitor does not hinder the binding of the guanine nucleotide from reaching the maximum level of binding at high concentrations of guanine nucleotide. However, the binding of guanine nucleotide in the presense of a non-competitive inhibitor could potentially not reach the same maximum as without the inhibitory compound. In other words, the outcome of non-competitive inhibitors would be that the maximum binding sites available have been lowered. This assay were carried out to assess the mechanism of action for this compound in the condition of EDTA buffer. The protein target (4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Binding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-CDC42-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with 1 milliM EDTA and either DMSO or 10 microM compound and subsequently adding 50 microL of varying concentration (range 0-125 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population. Non-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were assessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP (10 microM). Calculations: The specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured at different fluorescent GTP concentrations in the presense of blocking non-fluorescent GTP (RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO): SpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP These specific binding values were then fit to an One site binding (hyperbola) equation: BoundGTP = Bmax * [GTP]/(Kd + [GTP]) where BoundGTP is the bound fluorescent GTP, [GTP] is the concentration of fluorescent GTP in nanoM, Bmax is the calculated value of maximum binding sites for GTP, and Kd is the observed affinity of GTP to the guanine nucleotide binding protein under those conditions.  PUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the different extimates of Bmax in the presense of DMSO or 10 microM inhibitory compound. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100 *(BmaxDMSO-BmaxCmpd)/BmaxDMSO where BmaxDMSO is the Bmax calculated in the presense of DMSO and BmaxCmpd is the Bmax calculated in presense of 10 microM inhibitory compound. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_SCORE greater than 50.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 1265), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of STAT1. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862 and AID 1265; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 920); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition" (AID 1308); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 1317). In this assay STAT1 inhibition was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct.  Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated induction of STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 inhibitor will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The inhibitor and activator dose response counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (334 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration) was dispensed into all wells. The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Beta-glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. The inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase results in Gaucher disease, which is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bony lesions and bone marrow infiltration with characteristic storage cells, known as Gaucher cells. There are also forms of the disorder affecting the central nervous system. Patients with the same genotypes can manifest with diverse clinical presentations and it is believed that improper folding and trafficking of beta-glucocerbrosidase may contribute to the phenotypes observed. Low molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of misfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby enhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Using normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule inhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms. Two pro-fluorescent substrates were chosen for two screens against a small molecule library. One beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The second assay used Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside, generating a blue fluorescent product. The Km for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside and Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside were determined to be 71.2 uM and 855 uM, respectively. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, were determined to be 87.5 uM and 117 uM, respectively. The use of two difference pro-fluorescent substrates in the screens helped to eliminate false positives. All compounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s). Both enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium taurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both assays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a final concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM. This particular assay protocol is for the "red" substrate, and it was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: Red fluorescence substrate assay: 2 uL enzyme 23 nL compound 1 uL substrate (final concentration of 30 uM) Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes Read the plate in Viewlux plate reader (Ex=548(7) and Em=600(10)).

Description:  Cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)," (PubChem AID 793). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 25 nL of either test compound (2.8 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO, High Control (0.28 uM final nominal concentration BIIE0246) or Low Control (1 uM DMSO) was added to the appropriate wells. Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (8 nM final nominal concentration; NPY's EC95) in PBS. The plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 micromolar final concentration; isoproterenol's EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (25 uM final concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before the final read using the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T30 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T30 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 30 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control)))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge High_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Assay Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. A biochemical fluorescence-intensity assay in 1536-well microplate format was developed to measure TAg ATPase activity in the presence of potentially inhibitory compounds. Z values are ~0.68, with > 3-fold S/B and a high (5%) DMSO tolerance. The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Assay buffer was 100mM Tris-HCl, 20mM KCl, 6mM MgCl2, and 0.1mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4. Initially, 250nl of test compound (20uM final concentration) in 4% DMSO/assay buffer was added to the respective plate wells. Total reaction volume (without endpoint reagent) was 1.25ul. Total read volume (with endpoint reagent) was 5 ul. Enzyme and buffer volumeswere dispensed using a BioRAPTR FRD (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 500 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified TAg was diluted to a concentration of 0.0144 ug/ul in assay buffer. 750nl of TAg (14.4ng/ul, 10.8ng total) in assay buffer was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30m at ambient temperature. Following incubation, 250nl of 5mM ATP (A7699, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in assay buffer was added to the respective wells, and incubated for 120m at ambient temperature. Final DMSO concentration was 1.0%. Endpoint addition and read: After incubation, the ADPHunter-Plus Kit (DiscoverX, Freemont, CA) was used to determine the extent of TAg-induced ATP hydrolysis. 1.25ul of Reagent A, immediately followed by 2.5ul of Reagent B, was added to the wells, and allowed to incubate for a further 10m at ambient temperature. Addition of the kit stop solution had no effect on the assay and subsequently was not used. The plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 530/590nm respectively. This counter screening assay was performed to determine whether selected active compounds from the primary screen interfered with screening reagents or detection methods in the absence of TAg. In this case the addition of 50 uM ADP simulated assay signal. Compounds were added in dose response format. The assay interference counter screen was read 10 minutes following the addition of the endpoint reagent. Controls and Drug Addition: Controls included full reaction wells (TAg, DMSO blank, and ATP), background wells (Assay buffer, DMSO blank, and ATP), and control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate. Positive control drug (Mal112B) was diluted in 4% DMSO/assay media and added to each plate (250nl at 5x concentration), for a final concentration of 100uM. 2.5nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 20uM. DMSO concentration from the compounds amounted to 0.2%, bringing the total per well to 1%. DMSO in control wells was also supplemented, to maintain a concentration of 1% for all wells of each plate. Large T Antigen purification: TAg was purified essentially as described by Cantalupo, P., et. al.,1999. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with a TAg-encoding baculovirus. At 45 hpi, cells were harvested and lysed in LiCl and NP40-containing lysis buffer. The lysate was spun at 27000g and the high speed supernatant was loaded to a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column to which the resin had been covalently crosslinked to the monoclonal antibody PAb419 (Harlow, E. et. al., 1981). PAb419 has been previously described to recognize an N-terminal epitope of TAg. The column was washed, and then eluted at high pH. TAg containing fractions were dialyzed into 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM DTT, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. Data Analysis: 96 full reaction wells, 96 background wells, and 64 control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z score for the primary assay was 0.6. Results were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and calculated as: 100*((Median Enzyme Control-High Dose Ctrl Drug) - (Test well-High Dose Ctrl Drug))/(Median Enzyme Ctrl-High Dose Ctrl Drug). Dose response results for each concentration were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Compounds showing at least 30% inhibition were considered active and IC50 values were calculated using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and minimum locked at 100 and 0.

Description:  Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland which belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a seven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s) protein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and regulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with thyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after surgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small molecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and physiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small molecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has ever been reported. A confirmatory assay of putative TSHR agonists was conducted on a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing the TSHR, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: an ELISA based cAMP competition assay using cAMP-Screen Direct System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City , CA). HEK 293 cells expressing TSHR were cultured for 24 h before incubation for 1 h in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (SIGMA) and small molecule ligands in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37C. Following aspiration of the medium, cells were lysed using lysis buffer of the cAMP-Screen DirectTM System (Applied Biosystems). The cAMP content of the cell lysate was determined using the method described in the manufacturer#s protocol. An enzyme substrate with a luminescent enhancer generates glow light emission kinetics. Light signal intensity, which is inversely proportional to the cAMP level in the sample, is measured in a luminometer (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel, Victor 3) for 3 seconds/well 30 min after substrate addition. Potencies (i.e., EC50) of the ligands were obtained from dose-response curves by data analysis with GraphPad Prism 4 software for Windows.

Description:  Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Agonists of the S1P2 Receptor A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity.  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul (100, 000 cells/well) of cell suspension was dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to sample or control wells, respectively.  Next, 1.1 ul of S1P in 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 1 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm.  Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: Percent Activation = 100 *(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells) Where: Test compound well is defined as wells containing compound from the MLSCN library compound library Well ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength. Negative control is defined as well containing 2 percent fatty acid free BSA Positive control is defined as well containing 1 uM S1P Each compound was assayed in triplicate using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 42 uM.  For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42.8 uM) did not result in > 50 percent activation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50percent activation is observed. This algorithm results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Next, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. The average percent activation and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen (AID 2435) was declared active.

Description:  A luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for this assay. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is not present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no luminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates with the presence of inviable cells. This campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive control. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately 100 nM.  All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well format.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the kidney mesenchymal cell line which is derived from normal human renal glomeruli. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the kidney mesenchymal cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The cytochrome P450 enzymes represent a diverse superfamily of hemoproteins present in eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaean systems. The primary function of these enzymes is in the metabolism and clearance of both endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds due to their propensity to metabolize multiple substrates through the catalysis of a range of reactions. CYP2C9 is an important enzyme in this superfamily in its ability to metabolize a diverse range of substrates including non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and sulfonylureas. There is a growing body of the evidence that CYP isoforms have multiple compound-binding interacting sites that influence the specific activity of the enzyme. A crystal structure of CYP2C9 in the presence of warfarin demonstrated its binding in a novel allosteric site. Compounds activating CYP2C9 could stimulate metabolism of natural substrates of the enzyme and therefore, could provide valuable tools for their characterization. In the assay, we tested the ability of compounds from MLSMR compound collection to activate the 2C9-catalyzed conversion of the substrate luciferin-H EGE to luciferin EGE detected using luciferase reaction. Materials: 1) Human 2C9 enzyme - (BD Biosciences, cat # 456258) 2) Substrate - Luciferin-H (Promega) 3) Luciferin detection reagent (Promega) 4) Components of NADPH regeneration system were from Sigma-Aldrich. 5) Negative control wells contained 0.25 mM sulfaphenazole 6) Positive control wells contained vehicle solution CYP2C9 HTS protocol: Assay was performed in 4-uL volume using 1536-well white plates (Greiner, 782075). Reaction was initiated by addition of solution of enzyme and luciferin substrate to the whole plate already containing compounds and NADPH regenerating system. Final concentrations of components in the assay were as follows: 1) 100 uM Luciferin-H 2)13.5 nM 2C9 enzyme 3) 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate 4) 3.3 mM magnesium chloride 5) 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 6) 0.4 U/mL Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 7) 5 uM compounds (columns 5-48) 8) Columns 1-2 contained positive control samples 9) Columns 3-4 contained no compounds

Description:  Full deck counterscreen for agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1): Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify nonselective activators and assay artifacts using the parental CHOK1 cell line. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that non-selectively modulate endogenous CHO-K1 cell GPCRs or that interfere with the assay format or calcium signaling. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)" (AID 588814). This assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8 fluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds. As designed, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Activation = ( (Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck counterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) activity. In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX1R receptor (CHO/OX1R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 739 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC77 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and, I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.

Description:  TR-FRET counterscreen for FAK inhibitors: dose-response biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 727), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 794), and that were active in a set of experiments entitled, "Dose-response biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 810), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of PYK2. In this time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based assay, PYK2-mediated phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate is monitored using a FRET acceptor dye which is coupled directly to the substrate. Substrate phosphorylation by PYK2 is detected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine PY20 antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate bring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur. As designed, a compound that acts as a PYK inhibitor will prevent PYK2-mediated substrate phosphorylation, thereby preventing the binding of the Eu-Ab to phospho-tyrosine residues and well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 70 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 ul/well of a solution containing 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 60 uM ATP in kinase buffer were dispensed into black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plates. Next, 35 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.7% final concentration) or staurosporine (143 uM IC100 (1 uM Final) concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 ul of 200 nM PYK2 enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) . After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 5 ul of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer). To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound = Wells containing test compound. LowControl = Wells containing DMSO. HighControl = Wells containing staurosporine. For each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 39 and active compounds range of activity score is 40 to 100.

Description:  In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied RNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific regulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard genetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality.  This screen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins required for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First, inhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding proteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function across nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent that specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate. The two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class tandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the germline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates posterior patterning and germline specification.  Both proteins can be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro.  Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate reader. 1) Probe attributes Small molecule that inhibits MEX-5 Works as a transient inactivator Kills embryos Does not bind to other zinc-finger proteins Assay Overview: The ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to screen for inhibitors of this interaction. 2024-01-W01-03 7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844) in duplicate assay plates.  Pre-dispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to two weeks. MEX-5 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was prepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master mix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004% IPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser (Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  The target binding sequence TCR2 is a Temporal Control Region in the 3' untranslated region of the C. elegans gene glp-1 (abnormal Germ Line Proliferation). Fluorescent TCR2 RNA (5'-UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA-FITC-3', Dharmacon / Thermo) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).  The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees for 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at room temperature.  The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light. Competing unlabeled TCR2 RNA (Dharmacon / Thermo) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25 uM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature. 1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr). The assay plates with pre-dispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on the Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either 1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well of competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells). The final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were: 20 mM tris pH 8.0 40 mM NaCl 0.004% IPEGAL 100 uM zinc acetate 120 nM MEX5 protein 2 nM FITC labeled TCR2 RNA 4 ug/mL tRNA type X 10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO For positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled TCR2 RNA  Plates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute. One hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer).  Total fluorescence from the P and S polarization channels was recorded along with the Fluorescence Polarization calculation.

Description:  This cell based assay utilized a cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG) as a biosensor for cAMP induction. HEK 293 cells stably expressing the modified CNG were purchased from BD biosciences (http://www.atto.com/products/actone/features_benefits.shtml) . Stimulation of cAMP production causes the CNG to open and subsequent membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent membrane potential dye (BD biosciences) was utilized to detect cAMP stimulation in cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 250 ug/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1 ug/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen) at 37C in 5% CO2.  This assay was used as a counterscreen to "Confirmation Concentration-Response Assay for Agonists of the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor", to control for compounds signaling through endogenous receptors and other targets of HEK 293 cells. High Throughput Screening. Freshly passaged cells were dispensed into 1536-well assay plates at 4 ul/well in DMEM containing phenol red (Invitrogen), 10% FCS (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 20 to 36 hrs before the robotic screening. The screen was initiated by addition of 4 ul/well membrane potential dye containing 100 uM RO 20-1724 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 60 min incubation at room temperature to allow for dye equilibration across the cell membrane. 23 nl/well compound or control was then added to the assay plates, which were incubated for additional 30 min before reading a Envision fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in bottom-read mode for fluorescence intensity (emission at 590 nm).

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to confirm OX1R inhibitory activity of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 434989). In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX1R receptor (CHO/OX1R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 5 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 739 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC77 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. The average percent inhibition and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen (AID 434989) was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-28, and for inactive compounds 28-0.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process.  Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators.  Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP.  23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme). To monitor activation, the first column contained a titration of the activator, NCGC00031955-01 (16-point 1:2 dilutions in duplicate starting at 57 uM) and the first 16 rows of column 4 contained 57 uM of NCGC00031955-01.

Description:  Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for KLF5 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line in triplicate. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)," (PubChem AID 1700) were nonselective due to cytotoxicity of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6). In this assay non-transformed rat IEC-6 cells are incubated with tests compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega) to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 4 micromolar. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. This assay was conducted with compounds and analogs designated as active in the confirmation and counter screens.  These compounds were first evaluated using the primary biochemical assay based on % ATPase activity. Those showing <=40% ATPase activity were deemed sufficiently active for continuation to this secondary screen in BSC1 (ATCC CCL-26) cells. Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown, and plated in 96-well microplates in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS.  Compounds were added to the cells, followed by 100 TCID50 units of SV40 virus, and the plates were incubated for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. MAL211B was used as a positive control.  Additional wells were included to evaluate the effects of the same concentrations of compounds in the absence of virus.  At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal in the no virus wells.  Increased cell viability in the compound + virus wells indicates effective compounds.  Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  Compounds that show less than 50% toxicity at concentration twice or greater than that of the  cell viability efficacy IC50 will be considered as active. Data Analysis: 8 cell control wells (- virus) and 8 infected wells (cells + virus) per plate were used to calculate drug efficacy value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. Efficacy was performed in triplicate on each plate, and cytoxicity was performed in duplicate.  Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) of cell viability and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - virus control)/(cell control - virus control). From these curves IC50 values were calculated.

Description:  A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 activation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators would increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely proportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1 agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. To discover both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators, the primary uHTS campaign was run in "potentiator" mode, described as follows. All compounds were tested in the presence of the EC20 (2 nM) of the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 and the EC80 (4 micromolar) of forskolin. The EC20 of SEW2871 was used in order to identify both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained the EC100 of SEW2871 (1 micromolar) and the EC80 of forskolin. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was used, stably transfected with human S1P1 receptor (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct. Cells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks (part#431080) at 37 degrees C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen# part#11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone part#SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen part#1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen part#11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen# part#15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen part#25030-081), 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen part#10131-027), and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen part#15140-122). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and SEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar (forskolin's EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871's EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871 was also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e. its EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer#part#K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma part#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:  A multiplexed cellular assay was developed to determine the effects of small molecule compounds on MT1-MMP transcription, as well as their effect on cell viability/proliferation on HT1080 cells that have been stably transfected with the luciferase gene under the control of the MT1-MMP promoter. The assay was performed in a 384 well format.  By having two readouts, it is possible to eliminate from the hit list cytotoxic compounds that would also show a decrease in reporter gene level. Cytotoxicity/Cell viability is measured using Alamar Blue (resazurin) that detects respiratory activity of live proliferating cells. The generation of the reduced product, resorufin, was detected in fluorescence mode. The data for this portion of the screen are located in AID 620, Fluorescent HTS Cytotoxicity/Cell viability assay (HT 1080 cells). MT1-MMP gene transcription is measured using a luminescence readout.  Induction of MT1-MMP transcription causes the elevation of luciferase transcription via a reporter gene construct.  The amount of luciferase produced is quantified using SteadyLite HTS reagent.  The data for this portion of the screen are located in this AID. Compounds inhibiting luciferase activity would also appear as hits, i.e. false positives, of the reporter gene assay. To identify these compounds a luciferase functional assay was implemented and utilized in dose-response follow-up studies. The data for this portion of the screen are located in AID 773, Counter screen for luciferase-based assays positives.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the BJ cell line from ATCC which is derived from normal human foreskin fibroblasts. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the BJ cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls.  Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen).  AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  With over 30 million people infected worldwide, and an estimated 2.5 million new infections and 2.1 million AIDS-related deaths occurring each year, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a significant public health and socioeconomic impact throughout the world.  Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent HIV-1 infection, and although numerous antiretroviral drugs have been approved by the FDA, development of drug resistance to these drugs remains a significant problem for the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals.  The fusion of HIV-1 with the cellular membrane during entry of the virus into a cell is an established target for inhibition of HIV-1 infection, however only one drug (Fuzeon/enfuvirtide/T20) is currently FDA-approved, and no small molecule inhibitors of this target are available.  Hence, this program will provide chemical probes from which to optimize leads for the development of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. The CCR5 Tropic HIV-1 Fusion Inhibition Assay (PMID 16314403 and 18316528) uses two different cell lines to detect HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. The first cell line (MAGI-CCR5 cells; (PMID 9094670); obtained from the NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) has been engineered to express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and to contain an HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct.  The second cell line (HeLa-R5-16; (PMID 16314403); obtained as a kind gift from Roche Palo Alto, LLC) has been engineered to express the Envelope protein (Env) from the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and also to express the Tat protein from HIV-1 NL4 3.  Expression of CCR5-tropic Env in the HeLa-R5-16 cells is induced from the Tet On promoter through treatment with Doxycycline, while Tat is constitutively expressed by the cells.  Co culturing of the two cell lines leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, thereby introducing HIV-1 Tat from the HeLa-R5-16 cells into the MAGI-CCR5 cells, which results in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct and upregulation of beta galactosidase expression.  As a result, beta galactosidase activity, which is measured as a luminescent signal, serves as a reporter for monitoring HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and its inhibition.  In the absence of an inhibitor, co-cultures of the two cell lines exhibit a high basal level of beta galactosidase activity. Compounds that inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion prevent the upregulation of beta galactosidase expression, resulting in a low luminescent signal.  This assay identifies compounds that inhibit the viral attachment, fusion, and related events associated with HIV-1 entry into a cell. Materials: 384-well plate (Corning, catalog number 3712), Beta-Glo Luciferase (Promega), Doxycycline hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals), Maraviroc, and DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV) Cell Culture:  The two cell lines used were MAGI-CCR5 cells (engineered to express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and containing an HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct) and HeLa-R5-16 cells (engineered to express the Envelope protein from the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and the Tat protein from HIV-1 NL4 3). The HeLa R5-16 effector cells were sub-cultured in DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV) with 10% FBS, 100 ug/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamine, 1X NEAA (Non-essential amino acids) and 500 ug/mL G418 (complete growth medium), while the MAGI-CCR5 target cells were sub-cultured in complete growth medium containing 1 ug/mL Puromycin. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide, and maintained at sub-confluent density for no more than 20 passages. Compound Dosing/Plating:  Carrier or Maraviroc diluted in complete growth medium containing 1 ug/mL Doxycycline (assay medium) to prepare a 5X concentrated dosing solution (200 nM Maraviroc/5% DMSO) was dispensed into 384-well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates (5 uL volume) with a Biomek FX [After cell addition, this should result in a final culture volume in assay plates of 25 uL, with final concentrations of 40 nM Maraviroc and 1% DMSO]. Test compounds were serially diluted in a plate-to-plate matrix or "stacked plate" dose response format.  All 320 compounds in a source plate were diluted together through the 10-plate matrix resulting in a 10-point dose response dilution series. It can be visualized as a serial dilution series proceeding vertically through a stack of plates with the high dose plate on top and the low dose plate on the bottom with the final compound concentration ranging from 0.098 to 50 uM and a final DMSO concentration of 1% for all concentrations. Cell Plating:  On ice and while stirring, MAGI CCR5 (500,000 cells/mL) and HeLa-R5-16 (300,000 cells/mL) cells were mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio and 20 uL of the mixture of the two cell lines dispensed to get 5000 MAGI and 3000 HeLa cells per well. Plates were incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2 for at least 40 h (40-48 h). Endpoint/Detection: At the end of the treatment period, 25 uL of Beta-Glo reagent was added and assay plates incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, in the dark. Luminescence (0.1 second integration time) was read on a PerkinElmer EnVision multilabel plate reader. Data Analysis: Thirty-two control wells containing cells treated with DMSO vehicle and 24 wells containing Maraviroc were included on each assay plate to calculate Z value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. Z values ranged from 0.72 to 0.80 with a mean of 0.76. Compound data was normalized and reported as % Inhibition which was calculated using the following formula: % Inhibition = 100*(1-(Cmpd Lum-Med pos Ctrl)/(Med Neg Ctrl-Med Pos Ctrl)). The normalized % Inhibition was plotted against the tested concentrations of 0.098 to 50 uM. The IC50 values were calculated using XLfit formula 205, a 4 parameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm allowing extrapolation to identify weakly active compounds.

Description:  Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1): Purchased Analogues. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for purchased structural analogues of an S1P3 agonist (SID 7967985) identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "S1P3 Agonist Dose-Response Potency Assay" (PubChem AID 439). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a recent set of experiments entitled, "Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3): Purchased Analogues" (PubChem AID 1192). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P1 (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 agonism by test compound.  Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases production of cAMP and therefore transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene, as measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate.  S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect.  As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P1 agonist will increase S1P1 activity, inhibit BLA transcription, leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 10 uM. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.3 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension (3000 cells) to each well, followed by incubation for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2.  Then 10 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One ul of forskolin (2 uM final concentration) was dispensed to test and negative control wells. Additionally, 1.1 ul of SEW2871 (1 uM final concentration) was added to designated positive control wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I590 nm/I460 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = 100*[1 - ((Ratio_Test_Compound -Median_Ratio_Positive_Control) / abs(Median_Ratio_Positive_Control - Median_Ratio_Negative_Control)) Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound and forskolin Negative_Control is defined as wells containing forskolin High_Control is defined as wells containing SEW2871 and forskolin For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this assay was to test the lead compound against a broad panel of targets to determine ancillary activity. MDS Pharma (The Triad, 2200 Renaissance Blvd, Suite 400, King of Prussia, PA 19406-2755) performed a Lead Profiling Screen of GPCRs, ion channels and transporters against the compound at 10uM concentration. The compond possessed a superior ancillary profile with only three activities >50% at 10 uM, and was thus declared an MLSCN probe.

Description:  Fluorescence polarization-based counterscreen for RBBP9 inhibitors: primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the serine hydrolase family member Fam108B. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of the Fam 108B serine hydrolase. This assay also serves as a primary counterscreen for a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant Fam108B protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108B inhibitors will prevent Fam 108B-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.51 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108B protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Catalytically dead Fam108B (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay Buffer was dispensed to positive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.0.951% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) Where: Low_Control is defined as the median value of all test compound wells. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108B in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108B (S170A) protein in the presence of DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-11, for inactive 11-0.

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen cat # PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates using Transcreener (trade mark), a competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assay [1]. For the present assay, we used the Orange TranscreenerTM ADP2 (BellBrooks Labs, Madison, Wis) detection system to monitor ADP production in the kinase reaction. In the assay, an ADP tracer exhibiting orange fluorescence is bound to an ADP antibody which can be displaced by the ADP product of the kinase reaction.  This allows the ADP tracer to freely rotate leading to a decrease in the observed FP value. The amount of ADP produced can then be calculated using a calibration curve. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat # 300801-52-9) which is a Clk4 inhibitor [2]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 25 mM Tris pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was dispensed into 1,536-well assay plates (Greiner, solid black medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Using a Kalypsys pin tool equipped with a 1,536-pin tool, 23 nL of compound solution was transferred to the assay plate. Two uL/well Clk4-buffer solution (6.25 nM Clk4, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentration) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well. Then 4 uL/well of detection mixture (4 nM orange fluorescent tracer, 1 ug/mL ADP antibody, final concentration) was then added after an hour and the polarization signal was measured using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) after 30 min of room temperature incubation using the following filters and program settings: BODIPY TMR FP dual Enh mirror (barcode 682);  BODIPY-TMR 531 (barcode 105) excitation; BODIPY-TMR FP P/S polarized 595 nm filters (barcodes 210 and 211, respectively); 100% light; 150 flashes; 1.35 G-factor; Detector gains were 685 for the 1st detector; 630 for the 2nd detector.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359) were nonselective. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP production or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of 0.1% BSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using: % Inhibition = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of a DMSO assay plate of wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 21 and active compounds range of activity score is 21 to 100.

Description:  Inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct.  In this primary assay approximately 195,000 test compounds from the MLSCN library were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds from the MLSCN library, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma.  Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 antagonist will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to identify compounds that act as helicase inhibitors due to their direct DNA binding. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, #Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3),# (AID 1800). In this assay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent intercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the intercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will compete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.9 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene aceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin oligonucleotide. Well fluorescence was read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent Displacement = (test_compound_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)/(positive_control_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Counterscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent displacement of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.

Description:  Human 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) catalyzes the inactivation of prostaglandin E2, and plays a major role in cancer biology by antagonizing the oncogenic potential of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2). Assays are available, based on absorbance/fluorescence increase of NADH with the substrate 15-OH prostaglandin E2. Inhibition of HPGD activity was screened by utilizing prostaglandin as an electron donor and NAD+ as an electron acceptor/cofactor. An increase in the fluorescence intensity due to conversion of NAD+ to NADH was used to measure the enzyme activity. This assay is a confirmation screen of primary qHTS protocol. Buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8. Enzyme Buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM NAD+ and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8. Reagents/Controls: Buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (no enzyme). Substrate/cofactor solution: 1 mM NAD+ and 30 uM prostaglandin (Sigma, prostaglandin E2, # P5640) final concentrations dispensed throughout the plate. Enzyme: 20 nM HPGD final concentration in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Column 1 and 2 is neutral (100% activity). A titration of control inhibitor GW5074 (G6416 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) top concentration 10 mM in DMSO, then 1:2 dilution for a total of 16 concentrations in duplicate) was pin-transferred into column 2. Three uL of enzyme were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid bottom plates. Compounds and control inhibitor (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 uL of substrate/cofactor solution was added to start the reaction. The plates were immediately transferred to and read 5 times every 30 seconds on ViewLux High-throughput CCD imager (Perkin-Elmer) using 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission fluorescence protocol. The fluorescence intensity difference between the last and the first time points was used to compute reaction progress.

Description:  Galanin receptor antagonism was measured using a cell line stably expressing human GALR2 and beta-lactamase (BLA) under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. GalR2 is stimulated by addition of a truncated Galanin (1-16) peptide, which couples GalR2 to Gq and leads to increased intracellular Ca2+. As designed, a GalR2 antagonist will decrease the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and will block the nuclear translocation of NFAT, subsequently reducing activity of the BLA reporter gene. Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. Antagonists will reduce or prevent FRET. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were used in this assay. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the assay start, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement and 1X antibiotic mix). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension per test well of a 1536-well plate (2000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 25 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour. To the appropriate wells were then added 21 nL of test compound from the MLSCN compound library in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 4 micromolar and final DMSO concentration of 0.4%) or DMSO only (for negative control wells). To the sample field was dispensed 1 microliter of Galanin (1-16) peptide in 2% BSA (final concentration of 150 nM, a concentration that resulted in approximately 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (basal activity resulting from 1 microliter of 2% BSA) were dispensed to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol was then added (1 microliter/well). After a further 2 hours of incubation at 25 degrees C, well fluorescence was measured on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound: Wells containing test compound Low_Control: Wells containing 1 microliter of 2% BSA in PBS High_Control: Wells containing 1 microliter of 1 micromolar Galanin (1-16) in 2% BSA. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score 0.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that are cytotoxic to non-transformed IEC-6 rat intestinal epithelial cells. This assay also serves as a counterscreen to a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)," (PubChem AID 1700). In this assay, rat IEC-6 cells are incubated with tests compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega) to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening assay for inhibitors of the Retinoic Acid Receptor-related orphan receptor A (RORA)" (PubChem AID=561) were selected for further testing in this Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) assay. SF-1 is a nuclear receptor that does not share significant structural homology with RORA at the ligand-binding domain. This counterscreen employs the same format as the assay used to select potential RORA inhibitors; except that here the biological target is SF-1. A compound that appears as an inhibitor in both the RORA and SF-1 assays would be less desirable for follow-up, since the compound may be a non-selective inhibitor or format-specific artifact. On the other hand, compounds found inactive in this assay and confirmed active in RORA dose-response experiments are likely to be selective inhibitors of RORA. This dose-response counterscreen assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the pFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute false-positive inhibitors of the RORA nuclear receptor. Among 278 compounds selected during the primary screening, 273 compounds were assessed in dose-response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. This assay was conducted in 1536-well format.

Description:  Dose response counterscreen for antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GalR2): a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of beta-lactamase activity. In this assay a cell line stably expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used. Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.  As designed, a compound that prevents FRET is considered a non-selective BLA inhibitor. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of 1536-well plates (2000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 25 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour.  Following the incubation, the assay was started by dispensing 21 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) to the appropriate wells. Then, 1 ul of thapsigargin (500 nM final concentration) in 2% BSA was dispensed to the sample field. Next, the high control (500 nM thapsigargin in 2% BSA) and low control (2% BSA) were dispensed to the appropriate control wells and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 ul was added to each well.  After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, well fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 2% BSA in PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing thapsigargin in 2% BSA. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 42 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 42 uM.  Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive.  Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by project collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30 nanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. This design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is associated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead sets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635 nanom. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7 might be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead control (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a fluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the test compounds. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of 218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds. RGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of the measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative control bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that particular protein is "inconclusive", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS Protein is "inconclusive", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant amounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702 compounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound (|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. RV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and RGS7, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library dependent "edge effect" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the data set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered "Active". Data from compounds located in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than 0 or greater than 135 were considered "Active". Active compounds include both activators - where %Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the 218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as potential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per protein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are RGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific. RGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel, which can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has the lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest bead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead set, the compound is flagged as "Potential Red Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as potential red fluorescent compounds. The Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library, average Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when excluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard deviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for target RGS16, due to the library dependent "edge effect", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68 standard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity of the protein. For easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the same compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an activator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column Ri_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where "i" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.

Description:  Late-stage results from the probe development effort to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): luminescence-based cell-based dose response assay to determine cytotoxicity of antagonist compounds. The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of a powder sample of a compound identified being a potent and selective antagonist of S1P4. In this assay, U2OS cells are incubated with test compound, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in six replicates in a 7-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 20 uM. Protocol Summary: This assay was started by dispensing U2OS cells in McCoy's 5A medium plus 10% FBS, penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100 ug/ml (20 uL, 200,000 cells/well) into the wells of a 384-well plate. Eight 1:3 serial dilutions of compound (100 uM in growth media) were made. 5uL of diluted compound or media were added to wells, giving final compound concentrations of 0 - 20 uM. The plate was spun for 1 minute at 1000 rpm, then incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator for 6 hours, then equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes. 25 uL CellTitre-Glo reagent was added to each well, followed by incubation of the plate in the dark for 10 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the Envision plate reader. The % growth inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: % Growth Inhibition = ( MedianRFU_High_Control - RFU_Test_Compound ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing cells treated with media only (no compound). Low_Control is defined as wells containing no cells (media only). Percent growth inhibition was plotted against the log of the compound concentration. The CC50 is reported as "> X uM" (where X = the highest concentration tested for which < 50% growth inhibition was observed). PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with a CC50 value of less than 10 uM were considered active (cytotoxic). Compounds with a CC50 value greater than 10 uM were considered inactive (non-cytotoxic). Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds. List of Reagents: U2OS cells (ATCC, part HTB-96) McCoy's 5A Medium (Invitrogen, part 16600-082) FBS (Invitrogen, part 26140-079) Penicillin / Streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122) Cell Titer-Glo (Promega, part G7572) 384-well plates (Corning 3570)

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 1267), were nonselective activators due to activation of STAT1. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871 and AID 1267; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 932); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB activation" (AID 1309); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 1318). In this assay STAT1 activation was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 activator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The activator and inhibitor dose response counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/ml of neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Signaling through the dopamine D1 receptor is coupled to the CRE/luciferase reporter system in HEK 293 cells. Compounds were tested in dose-response from 30 uM to 0.508 nM final concentration in triplicate for their ability to modulate the D1 receptor in the presence of dopamine stimulation. The signal readout from this assay is luciferase luminescence as measured by the Perkin Elmer Envision. Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEKs) containing human D1 receptor were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in Greiner black, solid bottom poly-lysine coated 384-well plates (Cat#781947) in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 5% Fetalclone I serum (Hyclone), 5% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 0.05 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). After incubation, the cell plates were cooled to room temperature for 15 minutes and 20 uL of SteadyLite Luciferase Reagent (Perkin Elmer #6016989) was added.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell line creation and culture of the human mGluR4/ Gqi5/CHO line. Human mGluR4 (hmGluR4)/CHO cells were stably transfected with the chimeric G protein Gqi5 in pIRESneo3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and single neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened for mGluR4-mediated calcium mobilization using the method described below. hmGluR4/CHO cells were cultured in 90 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 10 percent dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 ug/ml proline, 2 mM glutamine, 400 ug/ml G418 sufate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 5 nM methotrexate (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise noted. Fold shift determinations. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Human mGluR4/CHO cells (30,000 cells/20 ul/well) were plated in black-walled, clear-bottomed, TC treated, 384 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, North Carolina) in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Plating Medium). The cells were grown overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 percent CO2.  The next day, the medium was removed and replaced with 20 uL of 1 uM Fluo-4, AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prepared as a 2.3 mM stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 10 percent (w/v) pluronic acid F-127 and diluted in Assay Buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)) for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compounds were transferred to daughter plates using an Echo acoustic plate reformatter (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) and then diluted into Assay Buffer to generate a 20 uM stock. Ca2+ flux was measured using the Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS6000, Hamamatsu, Japan). Baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 47+/-20 nm, emission, 540+/-30 nm) and then 20 ul/well test compounds were added using the FDSS's integrated pipettor. Cells were incubated with test compounds (final concentration 30 uM) for 2.5 minutes and then increasing concentrations of glutamate were applied. FDSS data were analyzed using a custom analysis application. For fold shift experiments, 20 ul of test compound (2X concentration, 30 uM final concentration) was applied approximately 2.5 minutes prior to increasing concentrations of glutamate (10 ul of a 5x final concentration). Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate 3 fold or less, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '1'. For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate greater than 3 fold, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. 'Score' was assigned as '50' for those with a fold-shift less than or equal to 10 or as '100' for those with a fold-shift greater than 10.

Description:  To identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on GPR30, a competitive binding approach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This assay measures the ability of small molecules with unknown GPR30 binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to GPR30 in permeabilized whole cells expressing GPR30-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GRP30-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer#s instructrions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control; column 12 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen). Columns 2-11 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Primary screening was completed at 10 microM. Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 96- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen) wells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells. Compounds were considered "Active" if they inhibited more than 60% of binding at 10 microM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives." The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding compared with activity cutoff (i.e., 60%). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff (i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity cutoff: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff) where Cutoff was 60% and %Inhibition was the %inhibition above the Cutoff. The %Inhibition was calculated by: %Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF) where Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was the average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells (i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 1262). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932 and AID 1262; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 871); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB activation" (AID 1306); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 1316). In this assay STAT1 activation was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct.  Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 activator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 micromolar. The activator and inhibitor dose response assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/ml of neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells. The plates were next incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP3A4 to measure the dealkylation of luciferin-6' phenylpiperazinylyl (Luciferin-PPXE; luciferin detection buffer) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection reagent. Luciferin-PPXE concentration in the assay was equal to its KM for CYP3A4. Inhibitors and some substrates limit the production of luciferin, and decrease measured luminescence; activators increase the production of luciferin and luminescence. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 20nM CYP3A4, 25uM Luciferin-PPXE, 200mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at RT for 10 min. Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at RT. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted luciferin detection buffer. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents and further information can be found at http://www.promega.com/tbs/tb325/tb325.pdf. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (57 uM ketoconazole).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-M1) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate.

Description:  The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay, using a construct of DnaK corresponding to only the b-domain (residues 393-507), the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their binding affinity to DnaK using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. Materials: 1.  The gene coding for the E. coli DnaK substrate binding (beta) domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein contains 17 extra amino acid residues (MGSSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) at the N-terminus. 2.  The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography.  3.  DnaK, human Hsp70, DnaJ, and GrpE were purchased from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). 4.  The model substrate NRLLLTG was synthesized by the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). Protocols: 1)  Titrations were done using a VP-ITC from MicroCal (Northampton, MA). 2)  Full-length DnaK or SBD were used at 100 uM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.5-5% DMSO. 3)  Compounds were used at 1-1.5 mM (10-15x protein concentration) in the same buffer. 4) Compounds were also tested for their ability to affect the binding of the model substrate NRLLLTG.  Full-length DnaK was first titrated with a compound to saturation based on evolved heats.  5) The compound/DnaK(FL) complex was then titrated with model substrate NRLLLTG.  6)  Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software provided by the ITC manufacturer (MicroCal, Northampton, MA).

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones. This assay was performed to establish that the compounds tested increase substrate turnover by directly following the consumption of substrate and formation of product using LC-MS. The catalysis rate of the 4MU-alpha-Gluc substrate by acid alpha-glucosidase was measured using LC-MS. Various concentrations of compound were added to enzyme solution in tubes. This was incubated with substrate and then stopped with stop solution. LC-MS was performed on each solution to determine the amount of product. The formation of product showed a dose-dependent increase. (1) Add 50 ul of enzyme to 1.5 ml tubes (4 nM final) (2) Add 0.5 ul compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 50 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 50 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Run LC-MS and integrate peaks to quantitate amount of product

Description:  Fluorescence confirmation assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359), acted as agonists of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 15 and active compounds range of activity score is 15 to 100.

Description:  Confirmation cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary HTS Assay for S1P3 Antagonists," (PubChem AID 485). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under the control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a BLA FRET substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will decrease well FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and without antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P (0.8 uM final nominal concentration) prepared in 1% fatty-acid free BSA was added to the appropriate wells.  After 4 hours of incubation, 1 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells.  The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.  Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Prior to normalization data were corrected by subtracting "background" (ie, fluorescence values from wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = 100*(1-((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO Any compound that exhibited a percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 23 and active compounds range of activity score is 23 to 100.

Description:  Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as agonists of the human oxytocin receptor (OTR). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, for inactive 1-0.

Description:  To characterize binding of small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on GPR30, a series of dose-response curves were completed for compounds with suggested GPR30 binding ability in primary screening using a competitive binding approach using whole cells. This assay assesses the affinity of small molecules with unknown GPR30 binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to GPR30 in permeabilized whole cells expressing GPR30-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GPR30-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/mL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control; column 12 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen). Columns 2-10 contain unknown compounds with one compound per column ranging from 100 microM in row A to 10 picoM in row H in 1-log increments. Column 11 contains a dose-response of estrogen ranging from 10 microM to 1 picoM. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 96- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 100% binding E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using: %Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves. All curves were fit based on %Binding of E2-Alexa633 with no additional normalization using GraphPad Prism and the Nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis using a sigmoidal dose-response equation. A score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding at the 10uM point of the dose-response curve, where: 0 =  70% < %Binding 10 = 50 < %Binding < 70% 20 = 30 < %Binding < 50% 30 = %Binding < 30% A score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the IC50 value determined by GraphPad Prism, where: 0 = 10^-5 < IC50 10 = 10^-6 < IC50 < 10^-5 20 = 10^-7 < IC50 < 10^-6 30 = 10^-8 < IC50 < 10^-7 40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8 50 = IC50 < 10^-9 A score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the range of the dose-response curve of E2-Alexa633 binding using: RANGE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where: 0 = RANGE < 30 or RANGE > 100 10 = 30 < RANGE < 50 20 = 50 < RANGE < 100 These three scoring parameters were summed to give a possible PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds were considered "Active" if the total PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY SCORE was 50 or greater, "Non-Active" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was between 0 and 50, and "Inconclusive" if a curve fit was unable to be generated. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 3 for "Inconclusive", 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives".

Description:  A cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism. If the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha-16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The entire campaign was run with S1P as the positive control. In this assay, S1P had a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of approximately 200 nM.  All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar S1P (i.e. 100% activation). The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 4.5 micromolar final concentration. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activity of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. In addition, wells with fluorescence values that could be attributed to artifact were also chosen for further follow-up. For the confirmation assay, all compounds were tested in triplicate in identical conditions to the primary HTS assay. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-16 pathway coupling protein was used. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 2 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. The S1P positive control was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:     To identify novel compounds that can act as estrogenic activators, a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384-well format.  This assay monitors the potentiation of the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium. The interaction of ER-alpha with SRC1 under a low estradiol concentration brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, generating basal level of FRET. Compounds that can further enhance the interaction with increased FRET signal are identified as positives for further analysis. These compounds could either be conventional ligand agonists or potentiators of coactivator-ER-alpha binding that operate by a mechanism distinct from binding as agonists in the ligand binding pocket. Distinction between these two mechanisms requires various counter-screening assays. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 639 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha Coactivator Binding Potentiators, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was tested in 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar. Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of control is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Control = ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-alpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft, using this equation: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(X/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom The fitted value of X50 is reported as the EC50.  In some cases, no curve could be fit to the data: When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 9999 was substituted for the EC50. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 10000 was substituted for the EC50 Standard Error. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of -1 was substituted for the Pct Control at EC50. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 0 was substituted for the R2 value. The Pct of Control at the EC50 was then determined, representing the level of potentiation that this compound provided at the EC50 mark.  However, in some cases the standard error of the EC50 value was judged to be too high to be a reliable result. When an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, the Percent of Control at the Ec50 is reported as the "Reported Pct Control". When no EC50 could be determined, or when the EC50 standard error was judged to be too high, the percentage of control at 12.5 uM concentration is reported as the "Reported Pct Control".  The outcome was determined as follows: When an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, compounds with EC50 < 30 uM were reported as Active. when no acceptable EC50 was determined, compounds with Reported Pct Control >300% were reported as Active. The activity score was calculated based on the observed range of the Reported Pct Control values obtained, according to the following formula: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - ((IC50 - HighestPctControl) / (HighestPctControl - LowestPctControl)))

Description:  Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: Cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (PubChem AID 1359), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (PubChem AID 1539), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the EC10 NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y1 Potentiator Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 37 and active compounds range of activity score is 38 to 100.

Description:  Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to identify compounds that are nonselective OXTR agonists due to activation of the related GPCR, vasopressin receptor 1 (V1). In this counterscreen assay a CHO cell line stable transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, for inactive 1-0.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617 kinase. This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is cytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell viability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. The BaF3 EpoR-JAK2V617F cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red free RPMI supplemented as above. The assay was started by dispensing 5 ul of cell suspension to each well. Next, 28 nL of test compound (5.60 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.56 % final concentration, set as 0% cytotoxicity), or JAK inhibitor I (5.6 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% cytotoxicity) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 5 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. As one method of confirming the specific activity of compounds active in the primary screen (AID 1461), we developed an assay to measure the displacement of radio-labeled native ligand, NPS, from its receptor in vitro. The lack of displacement does not necessarily indicate that a compound is non-specific for the NPS receptor, rather, it indicates that the binding site is unlikely to be the same as the native ligand. The assay was carried out as described  with minor modification. Y10-NPS labeled with 125I was bought from NEN Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA). CHO cells stably expressing human NPSR were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured until reaching 90-95% confluency. Cells were washed with 1ml PBS once and then incubated with radioligand with or without compounds or in DMEM medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 20C for 1.5 hr. Increasing concentrations of compounds or unlabeled human NPS were used to compete with 0.15 nM [125I] Y10-NPS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM unlabeled human NPS. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 1 N NaOH. Bound radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.  Analysis settings: Nuclei Detection Threshold Adjustment: 1.5 Nuclear Individual Threshold Adjustment:  0.45 Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7 Minimum Nuclear Area:    70 Minimum Nuclear Distance:    7 Minimum Nuclear Contrast:    0.1 Cytoplasm Detection Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:   0.2 Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.1 Spot Detection Spot Minimum Distance    3 Spot Peak Radius     0 Spot Reference Radius    3 Spot Minimum Contrast    0.3 Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   1 3) Metrics calculated from Nuclei Images: Cell Count (NumberofCellsAnalyzed), Nuclei Area (AreaoftheNucleus), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei (TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus), Average Intensity of the Nuclei (AverageIntensityoftheNucleus) GFP Images: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm (TotalCytoplasmIntensity), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots (TotalSpotIntensity), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities (RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity), Number of Spots per Cell (AverageSpotsPerCell), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation (PercentagePositiveCells) 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. EC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. MEK protein was obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

Description:  Dose Response cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2). Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX(tm)-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.25 million/mL in assay media (DMEM as above except that the 10% v/v heat-inactivated bovine growth serum was replaced with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, while Geneticin and Zeocin were omitted).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed per test well of 1536-well plates (1000 cells/well), followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours.  After this incubation, 28 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of PBS (control wells) or galanin in PBS (positive control wells; 1 uM final concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1 ul per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol).  After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, luminescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing galanin. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (ie, 56 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 56 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (column 3) and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme in column 2). To monitor activation, the first column contained a titration of the activator, NCGC00031955-03 (16-point 1:2 dilutions in duplicate starting at 57 uM) and the first 16 rows of column 4 contained 57 uM of NCGC00031955-03.

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds.  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml.

Description:  The intraerythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs two cytosolic neutral aminopeptidases, an M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (M1AAP) and an M17-family leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP), in the terminal stages of host hemoglobin digestion. Their action results in the release of free amino acids that are used for the anabolism of parasite proteins and, hence, are critical to the development of the parasite in red blood cells. Inhibitors of the two exopeptidases prevent the growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro, and protect mice from infection with rodent malaria P. chabaudi, providing strong evidence that these enzymes are targets which can be used to develop new anti-malarial drugs.  Thus, Plasmodium falciparum M17-family leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP) is an attractive chemotherapeutic target and was used to screen a large (200K) chemical library to identify novel inhibitors as probes for this enzyme in Plasmodium falciparum.  A simple assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) was used for quantifying the activity of M17LAP. The rate of hydrolysis of this substrate was measured by monitoring the release of the -NHMec fluorogenic leaving group at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that fluoresce at these wavelengths. A total of 217,147 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 30 uM.  For follow-up testing, the 1139 most potent inhibitors were tested in a dose response assay at concentrations ranging from 100-1.0 uM. M17LAP Assay Protocol for 1536-well HT Purified recombinant M17LAP enzyme was provided by Prof. John Dalton, Institute for the Biotechnology of Infectious Diseases (IBID) University of Technology Sydney. Compound Dosing/Plating: For the primary screen 15 nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 1536-well black non-binding surface plates. This resulted in a concentration of 30 uM of compound in the assay.  For the follow up dose response assays 8 concentrations of each compound ranging from 100-1 uM were used. Assay Setup: 2.5 uL of M17LAP reagent mix, which included the fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) in assay buffer, was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 1536-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 2.5 uL of the M17LAP diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.1 mM H-Leu-NHMec and 100 ug/ml M17LAP diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% DMSO). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm at 35 second intervals for 315 seconds (10 readings). Each plate had 256 control wells in the eight outside columns with 128 wells containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 128 wells in which the M17LAP had been left out (background).

Description:  Assessement of equilibrium binding of guanine nucleotide to the guanine nucleotide binding protein can be utilized to evaluate if a inhibitory compound is acting at the binding site of guanine nucleotide or at an alternative, allosteric site. A direct competitive inhibitor does not hinder the binding of the guanine nucleotide from reaching the maximum level of binding at high concentrations of guanine nucleotide. However, the binding of guanine nucleotide in the presense of a non-competitive inhibitor could potentially not reach the same maximum as without the inhibitory compound. In other words, the outcome of non-competitive inhibitors would be that the maximum binding sites available have been lowered. This assay were carried out to assess the mechanism of action for this compound in the condition of Mg buffer. The protein target (GST-Cdc42, 4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Binding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-CDC42-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with 1 milliM MgCl2 and either DMSO or 10 microM compound and subsequently adding 50 microL of varying concentration (range 0-100 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population. Non-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were assessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP (10 microM). Calculations: The specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured at different fluorescent GTP concentrations in the presense of blocking non-fluorescent GTP (RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO): SpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP These specific binding values were then fit to an One site binding (hyperbola) equation: BoundGTP = Bmax * [GTP]/(Kd + [GTP]) where BoundGTP is the bound fluorescent GTP, [GTP] is the concentration of fluorescent GTP in nanoM, Bmax is the calculated value of maximum binding sites for GTP, and Kd is the observed affinity of GTP to the guanine nucleotide binding protein under those conditions.  PUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the different extimates of Bmax in the presense of DMSO or 10 microM inhibitory compound. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100 *(BmaxDMSO-BmaxCmpd)/BmaxDMSO where BmaxDMSO is the Bmax calculated in the presense of DMSO and BmaxCmpd is the Bmax calculated in presense of 10 microM inhibitory compound. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_SCORE greater than 50.

Description:  Confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)," (PubChem AID 1515). In this assay, a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization in the well. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.94 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 ul of Assay Buffer (0.1% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 2.5 uM of RBBP9 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.794% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 ul of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 45 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (Test_Compound_mP -median_Positive_Control_mP) / (median_Negative_Control_mP - median_Positive_Control_mP)*100 Where: Negative_Control is defined as wells containing RBBP9 and DMSO, Test_Compound is defined as wells containing RBBP9 in the presence of test compound, Positive_Control is defined as wells containing no RBBP9 protein. Any compound that exhibited a percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 9 and active compounds range of activity score is 9 to 100. List of Reagents: Recombinant RBBP9 (supplied by Assay Provider) FP-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider) Tris HCl (Sigma, part T3038) NaCl (Sigma, part S6546) Pluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 1263).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920 and AID 1263; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 862); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition" (AID 1303); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 1310). In this assay STAT1 inhibition was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 inhibitor will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well luminescence.  Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 micromolar. The STAT1 inhibitor and activator dose response assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 50 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 microliters of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (334 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man, annually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. Glucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite, the bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that HK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is lethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been unsuccessful. Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have been developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. T. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome 10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical. TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian HKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and human HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets. Indeed, it has been suggested that the possibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote, and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long sought-after inhibitors a possibility.  Thus, a simple "mix and read" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the enzyme.  This assay was used to determine confirm the inhibitory activity of the primary hits via IC50 determinations.  Basic Assay protocol The basic procedure for the TbHK1 assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture components as follows: 1     15 uL of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound concentration range = 0-100 uM). 2     15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of 0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively. 3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL). 4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. 5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). 6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH        in the reaction mixture.

Description:  Inhibition of HADH2 activity was screened by utilizing beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A as an electron donor and NAD+ as an electron acceptor/cofactor. An increase in the fluorescence intensity due to conversion of NAD+ to NADH was used to measure the enzyme activity. Buffer:  100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, containing 0.01 % Tween-20. Reagents/Controls: Buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (no enzyme). Substrate/cofactor solution: 1 mM NAD+ and 90 uM beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) final concentrations dispensed throughout the plate. Enzyme: 20 nM HADH2 final concentration in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Column 1 is neutral (100% activity). Column 2 contained titration of apomorphine (Sigma-Aldrich, A 4393, PubChem CID 2215, top concentration 500 uM, then 1:2 dilution in duplicate) Assay Steps: Three uL of enzyme were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 uL of substrate/cofactor solution was added to start the reaction. The plates were immediately transferred to and read every 30 seconds for 4 min on ViewLux High-throughput CCD imager (Perkin-Elmer) using 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission fluorescence protocol. The fluorescence intensity difference between the last and the first time points was used to compute reaction progress.

Description:  Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO-K1 cell line. The purpose of this Artifact assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492964), are non-selective due to inhibition of Gq activity. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and parental CHO-K1 cells. In this assay, CHO-K1 cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of Gq activity. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Endogenous cellular IP1 production by the CHO-K1 cells will compete with labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that reduce Gq activity will reduce cellular IP1 production and also reduce the levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The parental CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of ATP agonist in DMSO ("EC Challenge"), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control -Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing Assay buffer and DMSO. The average percent inhibition and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff of 16.8% calculated from the sum of the mean percent response of DMSO plates and three times the standard deviation (Mean + 3SD) was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-9, and for inactive compounds 9-0.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. Assay Info: Membranes were prepared from M5-CHO cells according to a previously described protocol.  Binding reactions contained 0.09 nM [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) (obtained commercially from Amersham), 15-20 ug of membrane protein, and test compound (30 uM final) or vehicle, and Acetylcholine (13-point CRC from serial dilution) in a total volume of 500 ul assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).  1 uM (final) atropine was used to determine non-specific binding.  The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.264 nM.  Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm).  Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).  Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  True [3H]-NMS concentration was back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS used in the reaction.  ACh Ki in the presence and absence of test compound (M5 PAM or vehicle) was determined by the Cheng-Prusoff equation.  For all assays, radioligand depletion was kept to approximately 10% or less. The acetylcholine Ki in the presence of compound SID 85285486 was  10-fold lower than in the presence of vehicle alone. Therefore, the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active' and the 'Score' was assigned as '100'.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. The purpose of this screen was to test confirmed primary hits from the M1 Antagonist Screen for their ability to dose-dependently elicit a response at the rat M1 receptor under assay conditions similar to the primary screen. 1. Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing M1 receptor (ATCC#CRL-1985) were plated at 10,000 cells/well in assay media (F12 (Ham), 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES) in 384 well plates. 2. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3. Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 2.0 uM Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4. Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5. Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nm excitation and 540 nmemission filters. 6. Test compound in assay buffer + 0.3 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds (compound add step) simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7. Subsequently, approximately 8 nM acetylcholine (EC80) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds (agonist stimulation step) and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8. 0.3% DMSO, compound vehicle, and an atropine concentration series were added to each plate as controls for the compound add step. Additionally, assay buffer, 8nM acetylcholine (EC80) and 80nM acetylcholine (ECMAX) were added as controls at the time of agonist stimulation. 9. Test compounds were tested at 10 different concentrations resulting from 1 to 3 serial dilutions spanning the concentration range of 15 uM to 0.76 nM. Each compound concentration series was tested in triplicate. 1.  Maximum fluorescence signal was selected from the time window ranging from 200 seconds to 210 seconds. 2.  The average fluorescence signal between 180 and 190 seconds was used as a baseline value. 3.  The #value# for each well was determined as the difference of the max signal minus the average baseline. 4.  The values for each dose-response curve for each compound were treated as a group and fit to a variable-slope sigmoidal curve using Pipeline Pilot and the R-statistics package #drc# module. 5.  Plate-based control statistics were calculated using Pipeline Pilot. 6.  Replicate group measurements for each compound were treated independently rather than averaged over the replicates. 7.  Individual curves were classified into a #fit category# as either #fit,# #trend,# or #no fit.# #No fit# was used to describe groups where the curve fit did not converge.  #Fit# was used to describe groups where three or more actual data points lay on both sides of the calculated EC50. In cases where two or fewer data points were on either side of the EC50, the group was called a #trend.# This was done to acknowledge the increased uncertainty in curves where the calculated EC50 is less reliable. 8.  The overall activity outcome is an aggregate of all successful fits.  If a plurality of the replicates for a compound resulted in a fit or a trend, that compound was considered active. 9.  The activity score was assigned as 100 when 2 or 3 out of the 3 replicates were considered #fit.# The score was assigned as 50 when 2 or 3 of 3 replicates were considered #trend# or if one #fit,# one #trend,# and one #no fit# existed for a set of replicates.  A score of 0 was assigned when fewer than 2 of 3 replicates gave either #fit# or #trend.#

Description:  A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to measure S1P2 agonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. When the S1P2 receptor is stimulated by an agonist, transcription of the BLA gene occurs proportionally to agonist concentration, and BLA activity in the sample is increased. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. For this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with  human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 4.5 micromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 microliter of 2% BSA. The S1P positive control was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 3.3 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were incubated again at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and this mixture was then added (1 microliter/well). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from both the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation= ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/(Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Low Control: 2% fatty acid free BSA (Calbiochem, part#126609) High Control: 3.3 micromolar of S1P, corresponding to its EC100 (Biomol, part#SL-140) A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. The purpose of this experiment was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M5 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. NMS acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M5-expressing CHO cells as described [5]. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 micrograms of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1 micromolar atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 microliters. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1 micrometer pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30 micromolar, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less. Data Fitting: Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a  full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C. Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (~EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates. Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (~EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope).  The percentage of ACh maximum response values reported represent the Prism-calculated top of the concentration-response curve for three replicates analyzed together.  The M1 EC50 mean values reported represent the Prism-calculated EC50 values from concentration-response curves for three replicates analyzed together. Compounds with mean EC50s greater than 10uM were considered inactive (0). Active compounds with mean EC50s from 5-10uM were assigned a score of '50' and less than 5uM were assigned a score of '100'.

Description:  Lithium has been widely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. But lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and it can cause side effects such as thirst, weight gain, tremor, polyuria and memory problems. Although the mechanism for lithium action in treatment of bipolar disorder is still not fully understood, inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and the subsequent depletion of the inositol pool in living cells have been implicated as the primary therapeutic benefit of lithium therapy. Therefore, a selective IMPase inhibitor with reduced side effects might be a good drug candidate to replace lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Several IMPase inhibitors have been discovered previously. However, they are not suitable for therapeutic use because of their poor cell membrane penetrability or oral bioavailability; the development of new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors is needed. IMPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) to release free inositol. Binding of an agonist to a Gq coupled GPCR results in the activation of PLC, which hydrolyzes the PIP2 to form inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). While DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), IP3 triggers the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. The IP3 is very rapidly inactivated by hydrolysis to IP2, IP1 and then inositol by a series of enzymes including IMPase. Free inositols are used for synthesis of PI and thus start another inositol cycle. To identify new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors, we developed a cell-based IMPase assay in which the cytosolic IP1 is measured by a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. In this assay, an IP1 specific antibody is used to detect the labeled IP1 tracer. When the cell lysate contains the elevated IP1 due to the inhibition of IMPase, the TR-FRET between the labeled antibody and IP1 tracer is disrupted resulting in a reduction in the total signal. Since the TR-FRET is used, this cell-based assay is a homogenous assay without cell wash and medium change that is suitable for assay miniaturization and HTS. In this particular assay, a small amount of lithium is added to potentiate the response of weak activators. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (18.4 mM LiCl). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. (1) Frozen CHO-M1 cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F12K media containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4ul/well (2000 cells) in white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (250 uM carbachol and 500 uM LiCl in stimulation buffer containing10mM HEPES, 1mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 4.2 mM KCl, 146 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 50mM LiCl, pH 7.4) (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 30 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well of d2-conjugated IP1 (d2-IP1) and 1 ul/well of Eu+ cryptate conjugated anti-IP1 antibody (Eu+-Ab) prepared in the cell lysis buffer, both from the IP-One kit (Cisbio, MA). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (PubChem AID 1446), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (AID 1521), and that were inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for inhibitors of mutant JAK2V617F: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of parental Ba/F3 cell viability" (PubChem AID 1486). This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is cytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell viability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 uM. Protocol Summary: The BaF3 EpoR-JAK2V617F cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented as above. The assay was started by dispensing 25 ul of cell suspension to each well. Next, 100 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.4 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (3 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, 25 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the Envision reader (PerkinElmer).

Description:  Pimary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). In this primary homogeneous coactivator assay compounds from the MLSMR were tested for their ability to increase interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC2, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET). The assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that act as agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase the fluorescence at the acceptor emission wavelength. Prior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2 protein [aa 624-829]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing forty nanoliters of GW1929 (8 micromolar final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 micromolar final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated at 4 degrees Celsius for 15 hours. Next, the plates were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 minutes before being centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000 Where, I671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound is calculated as follows: % activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where, TestCompound is defined as wells containing MLSMR compound, LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO, and HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929 A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have RV less than 100. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. An active compound for RGS8 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 25 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The PKD HTS assay was developed and run at the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Screening Center (PMLSC) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)(1R03DA24898-01). Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases targeted by diacylglycerol. It regulates many fundamental cell functions including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and protein trafficking, and plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer in multiple organ systems. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of PKD are not clearly understood, and the role of PKD in cancer and other diseases has not been fully defined. This is partly due to the lack of effective pharmacological tools that specifically target PKD in normal cellular processes and in pathological conditions. The immediate goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an IMAP-based HTS fluorescent polarization (FP) assay and its use to identify novel PKD inhibitors. The assay we implemented is in a 384-well, small volume format and has been adapted for high throughput screening. Compounds identified in the primary screening activities were confirmed as PKD inhibitors by a 10-point dose response assay. The described IMAP-based HTS AKT assay was used as a counterscreen to determine the specificity of the identified PKD inhibitors from the 57K compound library addition (to the original 140K library that was previously screened). Protocol AKT counterscreening assay protocol for identified PKD inhibitors (384-well HTS) Reagents 1X kinase reaction buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 10 mM MgCl2 0.05% NaN3 0.1% Bovine serum albumin 1 mM DTT Substrate/ATP (3X concentration) 900 nM substrate peptide 30 uM ATP in 1X kinase reaction buffer Max control (3X concentration) 3% DMSO in 1X kinase reaction buffer Min control (3X concentration) 300 uM H-89 in 1X kinase reaction buffer IC50 control (3X concentration) 15 uM H-89 in 1X kinase reaction buffer Compounds (3X concentration) 2 uL of 1 mM compounds solubilized in 1X kinase reaction buffer starting at 300 uM (3X concentration) and subjected to a 2-fold serial dilution Enzyme (3X concentration) 0.15 mUnits/uL in 1X kinase reaction buffer Binding reagent 1:400 dilution binding reagent in 75% 1X binding buffer A and 25% 1X binding buffer B Assay Procedure (1)Prepare reagents as described above (2)Add 2 uL of a substrate peptide and ATP mixture to appropriate wells.

Description:  HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (HIV-1 NC) is a small (6.5 kDa) basic zinc-finger protein which participates in packaging of viral genomic RNA. The spacing and metal-chelating residues (3 Cys, 1 His) of the Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys Zn fingers are conserved among all known retroviruses. HIV-1 NC was assayed for its binding to the consensus sequence single-stranded 5'-TGTGTGTG. The assay utilizes fluorescence polarization (FP) where probe TGx4F (fluorescein-labeled 5'-TGTGTGTG) exhibiting low polarization is mixed with HIV-1 NC. The protein-probe complex exhibited high polarization, whereas inhibitors of that binding led to a drop in the FP value. High salt was included to increase the stringency of binding and inhibitor screen. Reducing agents and zinc were present to stabilize the nucleocapsid zinc-finger protein. Two uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Kalypsys black plates. The plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm. Compounds and controls (20 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, and then read on ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer). High-throughput CCD imager using fluorescein polarization filter set and 45 seconds exposure time.

Description:  .Measurement of TR-FRET detection format artefact in the screen for agonists of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). This assay complements a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 731). Since the positive control agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) activity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-3/PPARgamma complex, a sample well that exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-3/PPARgamma assay most likely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to identify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may have an erroneous activity assignment in AID 731. This assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in sample well measured immediately after addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact. Prior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed column 1-2 of the 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 ug/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762].  Next, the microplates were centrifuged for 30s at 300g.  The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000 Where,  I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation.  The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.   Any compound that exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible TR-FRET artefact.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7): cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit MCHR1; GPR24, the receptor for MCH, a cyclic hypothalamic neuropeptide that promotes food intake (14), increases leptin and insulin release (15), and modulates energy metabolism (16). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7)" (AID 1861), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7)" (AID 1952). This assay employs HEK cells stably co-transfected with human MCHR1 and a chimeric G&#945;qi3. Cells are treated with test compounds followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as human MCHR1 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hMCHR1 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 100 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of MCH peptide agonist (0.2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 180 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, MCH peptide. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the counterscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent response of a DMSO plate, and (2) three times the standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. % Inhibition values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-19, for inactive 19-0.

Description:  TR-FRET dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma): non-selective agonists. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 1048) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)" (AID 1301). This assay tests the ability of compounds to increase the interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-3 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that promote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 66 and active compounds range of activity score is 71 to 100.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), working with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), control the phosphorylation state of many proteins in the signal transduction pathways. HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. This fluorescent assay was developed and performed at the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics as a secondary assay for side-by-side study with the compounds tested in the "In Vitro HePTP Dose Response Colorimetric Assay for SAR Study" assay, AID 1059) Enzyme activity and its inhibition by screened compounds was measured in a kinetic assay based on hydrolysis of 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) resulting in a fluorescence increase due to 3-O-methylfluorescein release. 1)HePTP protein was provided by Dr. Mustelin (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2)Assay Buffer: 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 375 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.0125% Tween 20. 3)HePTP working solution contained 6.875 nM HePTP in assay buffer. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 4)The OMFP 20 mM stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10.5 mg OMFP in 1 mL DMSO and sonicating the solution for 1 min. Right before use, the stock solution was diluted to a working solution of 750 uM concentration. 5)Vanadate working solution - 45 mM Na3VO4 in 10% DMSO HePTP dose-response assay protocol: 1)Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22 of Greiner 384-well white small-volume plates (784075). Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of vanadate working solution and 10% DMSO, respectively. 2)8 uL of HePTP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 3)8 uL of OMFP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 4)Fluorescence (ex/em: 485/525 nm, 515 nm cutoff) was measured on M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). 5)The initial slope of the 4-min progress curve was obtained using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices). 6)Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc) using sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M3 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M3-expressing CHO cells as described. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 ul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less.

Nat Chem Biol. 2008 Jan;4(1):42-50. PMID: 18059262 Data Fitting: Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by project collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30 nanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. This design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is associated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead sets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635 nm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7 might be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead control (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a fluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the test compounds. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of 218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds. RGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of the measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative control bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that particular protein is "inconclusive", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS Protein is "inconclusive", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant amounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702 compounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound (|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. RV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and RGS7, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library dependent "edge effect" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the data set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered "Active". Data from compounds located in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than 0 or greater than 135 were considered "Active". Active compounds include both activators - where %Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the 218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as potential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per protein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are RGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific. RGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel, which can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has the lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest bead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead set, the compound is flagged as "Potential Red Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as potential red fluorescent compounds. The Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library, average Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when excluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard deviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for target RGS16, due to the library dependent "edge effect", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68 standard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity of the protein. For easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the same compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an activator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column Ri_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where "i" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.

Description:  The E3 ligases are involved in regulating other proteins by covalent ligation to the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin. This post-translational modification can result in altered conformation, altered activity, or degradation of the sustrate protein. Thus, E3 ligases are effectors of a major means of post-translational modification of proteins in many species, including mammals. The dipeptide boronic acid bortezomib  is a potent proteasome inhibitor, has selective anticancer activity in tumor cells and in mice and was recently approved for clinical use in multiple myeloma. MDM2 E3 ligase is involved in numerous types of human cancer. Selective E3 ligase inhibitors would be preferable as they would be more selective and less toxic. Cells were plated and allowed to settle at 37C for 4 hrs. The cells were then incubated with 5 uM compound (final DMSO conc:0.2%) at 37C for 2 hrs. SteadyLite luciferase reagent was added, plates incubated for 15 mins and then read on Envision reader.
