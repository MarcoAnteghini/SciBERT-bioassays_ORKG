Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP3A4 to measure the dealkylation of luciferin-6' phenylpiperazinylyl (Luciferin-PPXE; luciferin detection buffer) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection reagent. Luciferin-PPXE concentration in the assay was equal to its KM for CYP3A4. Inhibitors and some substrates limit the production of luciferin, and decrease measured luminescence. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 20nM CYP3A4, 25uM Luciferin-PPXE, 200mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at RT for 10 min. Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at RT. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted luciferin detection buffer. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents and further information can be found at http://www.promega.com/tbs/tb325/tb325.pdf. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (57 uM ketoconazole).

Description:  Confirmation at dose screen using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably over-expressing a plasmid containing 3 copies of the Hypoxia Responsive Element  linked to luciferase gene (U2OS HRE-luciferase cells) to identify small molecules inducing an increased luciferase activity in these cells. The small molecules inducing expression of luciferase under HRE promoter will be measured by the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin and light (luminescence) mediated by the luciferase. Identification of probe(s) activating the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. More specifically, EC50 determination of cherry-pick compounds from primary screen inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the signal obtained from the in-plate positive control (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO). U2OS HRE-luciferase assay: Summary of ELN assay protocols taken from Cbip ID runs: 2030-01-A01-04-01 to 2030-01-A01-11-04. The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line was originally obtained from Dr. Margaret Ashcroft's lab and kindly provided by Dr. Shawn Gilbert. The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line is propagated in DMEM media (Invitrogen, SKU#11995) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016) and 0.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, 10687-01) at 37'C in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening assays, cells are grown in T175 flask (BD Falcon, Ref# 353112) or Hyperflasks (Corning, Cat# 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using 7 or 75 ml Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (Cellgro, Cat. No. 25-053-CI) for 5 minutes and then the trypsin is inactivated with 7 or 75 ml of complete medium respectively. Cells should not be trypsinized more than 10 minutes because massive cell death will start to occur. Cells are centrifuged at 1000rpm/5min and resuspended in fresh complete DMEM media with phenol (Invitrogen, SKU#11995) as mentioned above (for normal cell propagation) or DMEM medium without phenol (Cambrex; Cat. No 12-917F or Invitrogen; cat. no.31053) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016), sodium pyruvate (only used with DMEM without phenol from Invitrogen (cat# 11306-070)) and without hygromycin B (for compound screening). Cell number is counted using a Nexelcom Bioscience cell counter (Cellometer(r) Auto M10) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS. Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform General system (GS) automation unit: Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  U2OS-HRE-luc cells are harvested and resuspended in DMEM without phenol (Cambrex, 12-917F) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen,10378-016) without hygromycin B. U2OS HRE-luciferase cells (from an initial cell suspension of 120,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, Cat.No. 8867BC) at a final density of 6,000 cells per well in final volume of 50 &#956;L. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing. 2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) and  incubated for 24 hours at 37'C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (Model STX 220IC)(General automation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate): 3.  The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators STX1000#1 and #2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 (Model STX 220HR) before the initiation of the pinning run. The In-plate positive control compound plate (sentinel)(100 &#956;M DFX (Desferrioxamine), Sigma-Aldrich D9533, BRD-K09821361-066-08-4), dose response plate (DFX) (12 different concentrations starting at 160 &#956;M and diluted 2 fold on each subsequent well) or vehicle (Base plate, DMSO) are already present in the Liconic incubator 8 at the beginning of the pinning. Both STX and Liconic 8 CO2 incubator temperature are kept at 20'C. First, the base plate and the dose response plate are pinned once using 384 well pin tool (100 nl) on pin table (GS) and transferred to assay plate. Pins are washed with methanol and DMSO between each pinning. Second, the MLPCN test compounds plates are pinned as well as the in-plate positive control (32 wells, 100 &#956;M DFX) are pinned consecutively one after the other and transferred into one assay plate. Each compound plate is pinned twice in 2 different assay plates (duplicate). The final concentration for the MLPCN test compounds is 7.5&#956;M with final concentration no more than 1% DMSO. For the Cherry picks retest (confirmation at dose), the MLPCN test compounds retest plates were pinned once (100 nl) with Cherry picks 1170 compounds at 8 concentrations with a dilution factor of 3 (starting concentration 33 microM). Finally, a second round of the base plate and the dose response plate pinning is achieved at the end of the run. 4.   After the pinning has occurred, the In-plate positive control, dose response and base plates are returning into the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 and the MLPCN compounds plates are placed back into the STX1000 systems. The assay plates treated with compounds are moving back to Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to be incubated for an additional 24 hours. Day 3 (Reading luminescence from assay plates with Envision): 5. The assay plates are physically transferred from Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to Liconic CO2 incubator 7 (Model STX 220IC). Each assay plate is pulled out of the incubator and cooled down at room temperature for 30 minutes on Liconic Carousel 1. 30 &#956;L/well (384 well) of Steady-Glo luciferase reagent 0.5X (diluted in H2O) (Promega, E2550) is dispensed using the the MultiDrop Combi/long tubing dispensing cassette from Thermo Scientific. The assay plate returned to Liconic Carousel 1 for 30 minutes to allow a complete cellular lysis. 6.   Luminescence is measured (0.2 second/well) using the ultra sensitive luminescence detector (384-well aperture, 0.5 mm height) in each well using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting). 7.   HRE activation is calculated based on the following equation using mean luminescence (RLU) values: Fold Activation = #Treatment - Background  No treatment - Background Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates  will be considered as active hits. Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in only one out of 2 assay plates will be considered inconclusives and the compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) lower than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates will be considered not actives.

Description:  The full-length NS3 peptide sequence in West Nile and Dengue viruses represents a multifunctional protein. The N-terminal 184 amino acid-long fragment of NS3 represents the NS3 proteinase. The C-terminal portion of the NS3 protein encodes a nucleotide triphosphatase, an RNA triphosphatase and a helicase. The NS3 proteinase is required for the maturation of the virus. The NS3 proteinase is responsible for cleaving the NS2a/NS2b, NS2b/NS3, NS3/NS4a and NS4b/NS5 junction regions. This proteinase is also responsible for the cleavage at the C-terminal region of the C protein. As is the case with a number of flaviviruses, the NS2b protein, that is located in the polypeptide precursor upstream of the NS3 proteinase, functions as a cofactor and promotes the proteolytic activity of the NS3 enzyme. The cofactor activity of the 40 amino acid long central portion of the NS2b is roughly equivalent to that of the entire NS2b sequence. Most importantly, inactivating mutations of the NS3 cleavage sites in the polyprotein precursor abolish virus infectivity. We hypothesize that the processing NS3 proteinase, which is an essential component of the virus life cycle, is the most promising drug target for anti-flaviviral inhibitors, from which novel, anti-viral therapies will emerge.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Apart of being a prototypical NF-kappaB target gene, recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 secretion (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007). The assay described below uses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a canonical NF-kB inducer, and is designed for identification of hits specific to TNFa-modulated pathways. We utilized this assay to assess selectivity of hits emerging from  the  NOD1- specific assay, "SAR analysis of GM-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD1 cells" (AID 2250) and NOD2- specific assay, "SAR analysis of Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD2 cells"(AID 2260) using IL-8. Protocol:  1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1 2. TNF-alpha (Sigma) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. TNF-alpha was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ng/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed. 5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve analysis.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-L) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. L-isoform: Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. The purpose of this assay was to screen for M1 antagonists using the human M1 receptor in a calcium mobilization assay. Assay Info: For measurement of antagonist-inhibited increases in intracellular calcium, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 receptors were plated in 96 or 384-well plates overnight at 37degrees C and 5% CO2.  The next day, medium was removed and the cells were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2uM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C. Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock concentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%. Acetylcholine EC20 and EC80 stocks were prepared at a 10x stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to the assay plates. Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS 7000; Hamamatsu) or a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol. Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the EC20 of acetylcholine followed 1 min later by the addition of an EC80 of acetylcholine. The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the EC80 response. Compounds designated as 'Active' reduced the EC80 acetylcholine response to less than or equal to 15% of the vehicle control sample, and thus were given a 'Score' of '100'. 'Inactive' compounds gave greater than 15% of the EC80 response when compared to the vehicle controls.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the renal proximal tubule cells which are derived from normal kidney cells freshly isolated from rat. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the renal proximal tubule cells with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:        To identify novel compounds that can act as effective ER-beta coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384 well format. This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-beta labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with LBD or ER-beta brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation. Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 633 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-beta Coactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was tested in 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar.  Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-beta protein: Biotin-labeled ER-beta-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide Procedure: 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-beta protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-beta protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% level of Y-intercept.  When the highest concentration tested (50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as greater than 50 micromolar.  Similarly, when the lowest concentration tested (1.5625 micromolar) resulted in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as less than 1.5625 micromolar. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 30 uM were considered inactive, compounds with an IC50 equal or less than 30 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on the observed range of the IC50 values obtained, according to the following formula: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - ((IC50 - LowestIC50) / (HighestIC50 - LowestIC50)))

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of STAT3. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). In this assay inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit STAT3 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80% STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor impairment due to the loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons involved in modulating function of the basal ganglia (BG). The treatment of PD has traditionally relied on strategies for replacing lost dopamine; Levodopa (L-DOPA), the immediate precursor of dopamine, remains the most effective PD drug (1). As the disease progresses, however, L-DOPA efficacy becomes unpredictable and many patients experience debilitating dyskinesias and behavioral disturbances.  Thus, novel approaches for symptomatic treatment of PD are desperately needed.  New therapeutic agents that bypass the dopamine system have the potential of providing more sustained efficacy and fewer side effects or could allow for co-administration with lower doses of L-DOPA to delay the development of adverse effects. In recent years, G-protein-linked glutamate receptors, termed metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have emerged as exciting new targets for PD treatment (2), particularly mGluR8. mGluR8 does not regulate transmission through the BG in normal animals and the mGluR8 agonist (S)-3,4-DCPG (DCPG) does not have antiparkinsonian activity in acute models of dopamine depletion or dopamine receptor blockade.  However, DCPG has robust antiparkinsonian effects in rodent models in which dopamine is depleted or receptors are blocked for more prolonged periods as well as in animals with chronic 6-OHDA-induced lesions of dopamine neurons. Interestingly, DCPG has more robust antiparkinsonian activity than do mGluR4 PAMs or mGluR5 antagonists. Furthermore, mGluR8 is not widely expressed in normal animals (3) and the fact that mGluR8 does not regulate BG or motor function except in animals with chronic parkinsonian motor impairments could provide an ideal profile for a novel antiparkinsonian agent that may be selectively active in PD patients. We and others have found that activities of other mGluR subtypes in the basal ganglia are dramatically regulated by loss of dopamine (4-7).  Using Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEKs) containing rat mGluR8, Poly-D-Lysine coated black/clear bottom Greiner 384 well plates, were seeded at 15,000 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The next day, FluoZin2 was added to each well and the plate incubated for 50 minutes at RT. The cells were washed with HBSS + 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4 leaving 20uL residual volume. The cell plate was loaded in to the Hamamatsu FDSS and 5 frames of background were collected before addition of compound at 10uM final concentration. Data collection continued at 2 sec intervals until the addition of EC20 glutamate/thallium stimulus, then the  sampling interval changed to 1 sec intervals for a total collection time of 4 min. EC20 and ECMax of glutamate controls were used to calculate the Z prime value for each window as a measure of assay robustness. The data were processed using an automated data analysis protocol  generated with Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and R statistics package (www.r-project.org). Data were normalized by dividing each value in each trace by the initial value for that trace. For each well, 3 windows were calculated as follows: 1)window 1 was the ratio value 5 seconds post-addition of compound; 2)window 2 was the ratio value 5 seconds pre-addition of EC20/thallium and 3)window 3 was the slope value between 165 and 175 seconds. Thallium flux modulators or "hits" were compounds where Z score > 3 or Z < -3 in Window 3. Windows 1 and 2 were used to evaluate fluorescent and environmentally sensitive compounds. Compounds denoted as 'hits' were given the score of '100' and outcome of 'active'. All other compounds were denoted as 'inactive' and given a score of '0'.

Description:  The cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of drug dependence and addiction disorders.  GPR55, an orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, has been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor, but its status as such remains unresolved due to conflicting results from pharmacological studies.  The goal of this project is to identify small molecule antagonists of GPR55, which may aid in the deorphanization efforts of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR55 in drug addiction. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits and further into endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. The GPR55 antagonistic action of a compound in the presence of the GPR55 agonist Lysophosphatidylinositol will be detected as a decrease in local aggregation of the GFP arrestins Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR55 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 100ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Agonist Working Solution: Lysophosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar #850090P, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 50uM in water.  5) Controls Working Solution: 2.5% DMSO diluted in water (for positive control wells: no agonist will be added to mimic 100% inhibition of agonist-mediated response; for negative control wells: LPI agonist will be added to mimic 0% inhibition of agonist-mediated response). 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Primary Screen Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman): a) 5ul of 100uM compound solution was added to columns 3 through 24 of the assay plates for a final assay compound concentration of 10uM and 0.25% DMSO.  b) 5ul of control (2.5% DMSO) working solution was added to column 1 and 2 for a final concentration of 0.25% DMSO. c) Plates were pre-incubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37 degree C and 5% CO2 prior to addition of LPI. d) After 30-minutes, 5ul of the agonist (50uM LPI) working solution was added to entire plate except column 1 for a final compound concentration of 5uM (~EC80). 5) Plates were incubated for 75 minutes at 37C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Hit Confirmation Procedure: A. Single-concentration Confirmation  1)Same as primary screen, except compound addition was done using the ECHO55 Acoustic Dispenser. B. Dose Response Confirmation 1) Same as  primary screen steps 1 to 3. 2) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Acoustic Dispenser.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 32uM to 500nM (seven doses), performed in duplicate and on 2 different days. b. For control wells, 160nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1 and 2 for a final DMSO concentration of 0.31%.  c. Plates were pre-incubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37 degree C and 5% CO2 prior to addition of LPI. d. After 30-minutes, 5ul of the agonist working solution was added to entire plate except column 1 using the Biomek FX . Final LPI concentration was 5uM. 3) Primary screen procedure steps 5 to 10 were followed.  Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings:    - 20x 0.45 NA air objective    - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels    - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emisssion filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters    - 2 fields per well for Primary screen    - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION   - Threshold Adjustment:    1.5   - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7 - Minimum Nuclear Area:   70   - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0.1 CYTOPLASM DETECTION   - Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:  0.45   - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjust.: 0.15 SPOT DETECTION         - Spot Minimum Distance:   3       - Spot Peak Radius:    0       - Spot Reference Radius:   2       - Spot Minimum Contrast:   0.25 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity:  1 3) Metrics calculated from... NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus"); GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  Actives from the primary screen were determined using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) by calculating the %activation of the "AverageSpotsPerCells" metric and using a hit criteria of Activity > 60% and "Number of Cells Analyzed" >100 and "TotalCytoplasmIntensity" < 500,000.  Wells with cell counts lower than 100 in the 2 acquired images were flagged "cytotoxic / low cell count". Wells with a very high total GFP intensity ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity" > 500,000) were flagged artifacts due to autofluorescence. All flagged wells were excluded from hit selection.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of PMA (phorbol myristate acetate)-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with compounds found to show less than 50% inhibition in an SFLLRN-induced FITC phalloidin assay. Platelet samples were treated with 30 uM compound. Following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 nM PMA.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation.  Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a specificity assay, along with an analogous assay using Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation of platelets, to determine selectivity towards G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR).  Compounds that do not inhibit surface expression of P-selectin from PMA-induced and Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation are potential GPCR-selective inhibitors. 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were incubated with 30 uM compound. 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 nM PMA. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.

Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in metabolism and the clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP1A2 to measure the demethylation of luciferin 6' methyl ether (Luciferin-ME; Promega-Glo) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection regeant. Luciferin-ME concentration in the assay was equal to its Km for CYP1A2. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 20nM CYP1A2, 100uM Luciferin-ME, 100mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at room temperature. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted detection reagent. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (57 uM furafylline).

Description:  This functional assay was developed for detection of compounds inhibiting the replication of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus(VEEV), strain V3526-luc. The virus expresses a functional luciferase while it is actively replication in host cells and the signal is proportional to the extent of the virus replication. The goal of the proposed project is to find probes specific to the West Nile viruses, therefore it is important to confirm the antiviral spectrum of the confirmed compounds to other viruses at a later stage. Antiviral compounds show different activity spectra to related or unrelated viruses depending on the specificity and mechanism of action of the compounds. Hence, the assay was implemented as a counter screen to the West Nile Virus anti-viral assay. This would provide the characteristics of the probe candidates for anti-WNV compounds. The assay measures a luciferase activity expressed in Vero 76 cells by V3526-luc virus infection using luminescence as the end point. A luciferase gene is encoded in the nsP3 gene in-frame so the activity is proportional to virus replication in the system. The screen for inhibitors of a luciferase expression in V3526-luc infected cells involves challenging 4,500 cells with V3526-luc virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.06 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The V3526-luc virus was prepared from BHK cells transfected with genomic infectious RNA at the SRI BSL-2 facility. The assay includes both cell and virus controls. The activity was measured 24 h post virus addition using BrightGlo luciferase reagent (Promega). Percent luciferase activity was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the virus-infected cell control x 100. The percent cell viability was taken as an assessment of antiviral activity. Cell Culture: Vero 76 cells were cultured in Eagles modified MEM (E-MEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS and 100 U of penicillin, 100 ug of streptomycin per mL (culture media). The cells are maintained at 37C, 5.0% CO2 to 100% confluence being passaged every four days. For cell plating, cells were detached from flask bottom by using Trypsin-EDTA solution and then re-suspended in a growth media VEEV culture: VEEV strain,V3526-luc was used for screening. The V3526-luc stock was prepared in BHK-21 cells. The plasmid which encodes whole genome of V3526 and luciferase gene has been created by Dr. Brett Beitzel at USAMRIID.  The stock virus was prepared by a process of rescuing virus from infectious RNAs. The infectious genomic RNA was generated from the linearized plasmid DNA, pV3526-luc, in conjunction with 7mG cap analogue by using in vitro RNA transcription. The RNA was then delivered into BHK C-21 cells by electrophoration and the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2 until cytopathic effect was seen (4 days). Culture media was then collected and clarified by centrifugation. 1.5 mL aliquots of the media were stored at -80 degrees C as stock virus.  Dose Response Compound Preparation and Controls: The compounds were tested in a dose response format using a 1:2 serial dilution with the highest concentrations starting at 133.3uM and 66.6uM depending on the stock concentrations available.  A total of ten concentrations were generated for the dose response curve with the lowest concentrations of 0.26uM and 0.13uM, respectively.  Carrier control (DMSO) and compounds were diluted in assay media to 6x and 5uL was dispensed to assay plates.  The final DMSO in the assay for all screening concentrations was 0.33%   Cell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 4,500 cells/well were plated in 15 uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity. Virus Addition: V3526-luc was diluted in the culture media to 30000 TCID50/ml and 10 uL was added to the compound wells and the virus control wells (0.06 TCID50/ cell). Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell control wells. All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated in an actively humidified incubator with 5.0% CO2 at 37C for 24 hrs. Endpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an equal volume of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-3 facility. Data Analysis: Thirty two control wells containing cells only  (Cell control),  twenty four wells containing cells and virus (Virus control) were included on each assay plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. And also eight wells containing cells, virus and control drug, Mycophenolic Acid at 5 uM were included on each assay plate. The percent inhibition of virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was calculated as: 100*(Cmpd Lum - Median Virus Ctrl)/(Median Cell Ctrl - Med Virus Ctrl). Percent inhibition values were used to calculate EC50 values for the compounds by using4 parameter regression curve analysis with ActivityBase.

Description:  Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer, genetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor suppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is essential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer therapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search for homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step of HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and stimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. Our goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as chemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer therapies. DNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51 protein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this assay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides (47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm and the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with the sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the photon emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an increase in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the duplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA strand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this fluorescence. We have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI and their dose-response is reported here. Materials Human Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence assay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer salts were from Sigma. Assay hRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min). Compounds (8.5 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by addition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min and then plates were read on Envision plate reader. Dose response protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop 3.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool 4. Add 4 ul reaction mix (containing hRad 51 and ss DNA with buffers) 5.Preincubate compound with the reaction mix for 30 min at room temperature 6. Add 2 ul ds DNA 7.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min 8.Read fluorescence on Envision reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 520 nm) Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (DMSO, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (heterologous DNA) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 85 uM to 2.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a dicistronic plasmid containing a viral internal ribosome entry site stem-loop sequence upstream of the 5'UTR stem-loop sequence from Prion protein (PRP) fused to the luciferase gene (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to non-specific RNA stem-loop binding. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]).  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep(Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation. Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform). In groups of 22, assay plates were delidded and stacked. They were then individually pinned with 100 nL compounds, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then moved in sets of 22 to room temperature and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then discarded.

Description:  Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland which belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a seven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s) protein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP).  The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and regulates their growth and function.  Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with thyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after surgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small molecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and physiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings.  However, no selective small molecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has ever been reported. This cell based assay utilized a cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG) as a biosensor for cAMP induction by potential TSHR agonists. TSHR cell line HEK 293 cells stably expressing the TSHR as well as a modified CNG were purchased from BD biosciences. Stimulation of cAMP production causes the CNG to open and subsequent membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent membrane potential dye (BD biosciences) was utilized to detect cAMP stimulation in TSHR cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 250 ug/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1 ug/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen) at 37C in 5% CO2.  HEK 293 cells expressing CNG but without TSHR (parental cells) were used in concert to control for compounds signaling through endogenous receptors and targets of HEK 293 cells. High Throughput Screening. Freshly passaged cells (TSHR or parental) were dispensed into 1536-well assay plates at 4 ul/well in DMEM containing phenol red (Invitrogen), 10% FCS (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 20 to 36 hrs before the robotic screening. The screen was initiated by addition of 4 ul/well membrane potential dye containing 100 uM RO 20-1724 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 60 min incubation at room temperature to allow for dye equilibration across the cell membrane. 23 nl/well compound or control was then added to the assay plates, which were incubated for additional 30 min before reading a Envision fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in bottom-read mode for fluorescence intensity (emission at 590 nm).

Description:         This work's aim is to identify chemical compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER stress using a cell-based survival assay. Using secondary assays, selectivity of these compounds for the ER stress pathway was defined, and the principal signaling events that are inhibited were dissected. Thapsigargin (TG) was used to induce ER stress, resulting in cell death [13]. Salubrinal, a known chemical inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) dephosphorylation [14], was used as compound/positive control in this sceen. Final concentration of each reagent is: (a)Compound control-Salubrinal : 100 uM (b)Negative control: DMSO 1% with thapsigargin treatment (c)Positive control: DMSO 1%, without thapsigargin treatment (d)DMSO concentration during whole procedure : approximately 1% (e)Thapsigargin : 15 uM (f)Library compound : 15 ug/ml (g)ATPlite solution : 40% of final culture volume (20uL/50uL) 1)Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were maintained in complete media at 32oC. * Tissue culture complete media: DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 I.U. Penicillin/ml, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Amphotericin 2)CSM14.1 cells were recovered from cultures by trypsinization, and suspended at a density of 7.5 x 104 cells/mL in DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, and same concentration of antibiotics in step 1. 3)Seeding 40 uL per well of the cell suspension to each well of 96 well plastic microtiter plates by 'Well Mate' liquid dispenser , and overnight culture at 32oC.   4)Library compounds were thawed at room temperature for 1 hour, and centrifuged to pellet liquid. Using a BIOMEKTM FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter), 5 uL of test compounds in 10% DMSO were added to wells in columns 2-11 of the 96 well plates (leaving columns 1 and 12 intact) to achieve an approximate final concentration of 15 ug/mL of test compound and a final concentration of 1.1% DMSO at this point. 5)With step 4), 5 uL of 1 mM Salubrinal solution was added to wells of column 1/rows A-D of each plate, while 5 uL of DMSO solution was added to wells corresponding to column 1/rows E-H and to all wells in column 12. Multi channel pipettor was used to dispense 5uL solutions in column 1, and 12 * Salubrinal solution (1 mM) : 10% DMSO solution of 10mM Salubrinal + 90% DMEM. * DMSO solution (10%):  10% DMSO + 90% DMEM 6)The plates were returned to the incubator for 2 hours.  7)A WellMate bulk reagent dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to dispense 5 uL per well of thapsigargin solution in, thus achieving a final concentration of ~15 uM TG, to columns 1-11, leaving column 12 as a control for data comparison (only DMSO/no TG). Instead, column 12 received 5 uL of DMEM (2% FBS, and same antibiotics concentration) containing 0.0375uL of DMSO by multi channel pipettor. * thapsigargin solution (150uM): 5uL uM thapsigargin solution is composed of 0.0375 ul of 20 mM TG plus 4.9625 ul of complete culture media with 2% FBS. 8)The plates were returned to the incubator for 24 hrs. 9)30 minutes before performing the surrogate cell viability assay in which cellular ATP levels are measured, the components of the ATPliteTM (Perkin-Elmer) kit were prepared.. 10)20 uL of ATPlite solution was dispensed per well using a WellMate. 11)Within 30 minutes, ATP luminescence was evaluated using an Analyst HT multimode plate reader (Molecular Device Corporation) in the luminescence mode. 12)Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). * For liquid dispensing in step 3), 7) and 10), small nozzle tubing (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was used.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput dose response assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID 1359), "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1539), or Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID 1710), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (PubChem AID 1703), and were nonselective due to inhibition of the parental CNGC activity. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP production or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 microliters of 0.1% BSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using: % Inhibition = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-68, for inactive 67-0.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:  Name: Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for HSP90 inhibitors: dose response biochemical high The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)" (AID 1789). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether compounds were nonselective due to inhibition of native luciferase activity. In this biochemical assay, native luciferase is incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit native luciferase activity will decrease well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 60 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 5.0 microliters of 0.026 micrograms/mL native luciferase solution containing 3 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase in Assay Buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 375 mM KCl) into all wells. Next, 30nL of test compounds were added to appropriate wells. After 10 minutes of incubation at RT, 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS reagent were added to each well. Next, the plates were incubated for 10 minutes and well luminescence was read on the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  The relaxin hormone is involved in the variety of biological functions in normal tissues and diseases. The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary gland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin signaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through regulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis. Significantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung fibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human relaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive heart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic sclerosis. Upon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. cAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP increase is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists of the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit. This assay measures activation of a cell expressing RXFP2, another GPCR targeted by relaxin, to determine the selectivity of compounds for RXFP1. This is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP2 receptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were lysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell lysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to a decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer only) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin). The EC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation 1536-well assay protocol for the HEK293 RXFP2 cAMP assay: (1) Add 3 ul HEK293 RXFP2 cell culture. 2000 cells/well in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (dispensed offline with MultiDrop Combi). (2) Incubate 16-24 hr at 37C, 5% CO2. (3) Add 1 ul 400uM Ro20174 in DPBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.005% Tween 20. (3) Add 23 nl compounds in DMSO solution. Final concentration was 0.5 - 58 uM. (4) Incubate 30 min at 37C, 5% CO2. (5) Add 1 ul cAMP-d2 in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (6) Add 1 ul anti-cAMP antibody-cryptate in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (7) Incubate 30 min at room temperature. (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=320 nm, Em1=615 nm and Em2=665 nm.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1, human M2/Gqi5, human M3, rat M4/Gqi5, or human M5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine. Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). These compounds had EC50s less than 10 micromolar for the muscarinic M5 receptor in the calcium flux assay, and therefore, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. Compound SID 85285464 had no selectivity preference for M5 compared to the other subtypes and was assigned 'Score' of '50'. Compound SID 85285486 was more than 60-fold selective for M5 over the other subtypes, and thus assigned a 'Score' of '100'.

Description:  The CHO-M1 (CHO-M1) cell line transfected with the rat acetylcholine muscarinic M1 receptor was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were maintained in call culture flasks with F12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) at 37C, 5 % CO2  in a humidified atmosphere. At 90-95 % confluence, the cells were then detached in 15 ml 0.25 % trypsin by 3 minutes incubation at 37C and centrifuged at 1000 RPM to remove the trypsin solution.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions . Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-002) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. qHTS protocol for CellTiter Glo lymphoblastoid cellular assay

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases. Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation.  Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,655 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 521 potential small molecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 757). In the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and determine potency.   Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Test compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. Beads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt, Rac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine different concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data points. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand concentrations, generating competition curves. Ligand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. In order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) - [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be statistically significant) - |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of LOGEC50) - |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE) - [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test compound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) - [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the compound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 - ||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|) In this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive compounds the activity score is 0.

Description:  A homogeneous coactivator assay able to measure interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-3 using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) readout has been developed. This assay is based on the efficient Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by the fluorophore-labeled antibodies, anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands that promote the association of the SRC-3 coactivator with the fusion protein will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies complex. Therefore, agonist activity is detected as an increase in fluorescence at the acceptor emission wavelength. The assay was run in black solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plate. Five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed column 1-2 of the plate. The remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 ug/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Microplates were then centrifuged for 30s at 300g. Forty nanoliters of controls or test compounds (8 micromolar final nominal concentration, 0.8% final DMSO concentration) were then distributed to each well. Plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius. After this incubation time, microplates were allowed to equilibrate 30 minutes at room temperature before being centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. After excitation at 340 nm, wells fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, accordingly to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound has then been calculated as follows: %activation = 100 x ((Ratio_compound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) with LowControl: test wells containing DMSO and HighControl: test wells containing 10 micromolar of reference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part#G5568) A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; Hcrtr1) activity. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 -( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-9, and for inactive compounds 36-0.

In this assay, rat IEC-6 cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay uses an alternate technology to confirm hits from the primary screen - homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine (Eu3+-AB) and the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). HTRF Assay Reagents: 1. HTRF reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT. Before use, 0.05% BSA is added. 2. His6-Menin protein, MLL-w.t. labeled with biotin. Stored in singe use aliquots at -80C. 3. MLL-w.t. unlabeled peptide as positive control: 10 uM final in HTRF buffer. HTRF Assay Protocol: 1. Prepare His6-Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-biotin at 80 nM in HTRF buffer. 2. Prepare His6-Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-biotin at 80 nM and 10 uM MLL-w.t. unlabeled mixture in HTRF buffer. 3. Dispense 10 ul per well of reagent in step 1 in columns 2, 4-24 in a black 384 well plate, dispense 10 ul per well of reagents from steps 2 in column 1. Incubate plate at ambient for 15 minutes. 4. Transfer 1 uL per well of compound to plate and incubate at ambient for 1 hr. 5. Dispense 10uL of the donor (6His-Cryptate, 3.5 nM final conc.) and acceptor (SA_XL, 10nM final conc.) complex in the HTRF buffer with 0.01% BSA. Incubate for 1h.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304) were nonselective. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP production or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of 0.1% BSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using: % Inhibition = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of a DMSO assay plate of wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 23 and active compounds range of activity score is 24 to 100.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of PMA (phorbol myristate acetate)-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with compounds found to show less than 50% inhibition in an SFLLRN-induced FITC phalloidin assay. Platelet samples were treated with 30 uM compound. Following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 nM PMA.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation.  Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a specificity assay, along with an analogous assay using Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation of platelets, to determine selectivity towards G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR).  Compounds that do not inhibit surface expression of P-selectin from PMA-induced and Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation are potential GPCR-selective inhibitors. Primary Collaborators(and laboratory where this assay was performed): 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were incubated with 30 uM compound. 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 nM PMA. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample.

Description:  Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to G#i and G#o G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as antagonists of S1P4. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting #background# for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 25 and active compounds range of activity score is 25 to 100. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Human plasma factor XIIa alpha was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Cat # HFXIIa 1212a). Substrate Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1595.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% Tween 20. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Factor XIIa alpha (3.5 ug/mL) was incubated with Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 2 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 10 uM compound. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (7.0 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine kinase involved in growth factor and integrin mediated signal transduction pathways. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) method to monitor the phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate by FAK was used to screen for inhibitors. The principle of the assay is similar to other kinase detection systems utilizing TR-FRET, except this method utilizes a novel FRET acceptor dye, ULight, which is coupled by direct labeling to the substrate. The level of substrate phosphorylation by FAK activity is detected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-peptide antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to the phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate brings the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, hence allowing FRET to occur. A potential inhibitor of FAK would prevent the proper phosphorylation of the substrate, hence decreasing the FRET signal. 2.5 microliters per well of a solution containing 2 nanomolar FAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50 millimolar HEPES, 10 millimolar MgCl2, 1 millimolar EGTA, 0.01% Tween , 2 millimolar DTT, final pH 7.0) were dispensed into a 1536 black solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. 35 nanoliters of test compound (final nominal concentration of 7 micromolar, 0.7% final DMSO concentration) or positive and negative control (143 micromolar staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 200 nanomolar ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 10 micromolar ATP in kinase buffer. After 60 minutes of incubation at room temperature (RT), 5 microliters of 1X LANCE detection buffer (Perkin Elmer) supplemented with 20 millimolar EDTA and 4 nanomolar Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature. After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (Perkin Elmer).   To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 Where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition= (1-((Ratio Compound # Median_Ratio_HighControl)/(Median__Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: LowControl: DMSO HighControl: 1 micromolar staurosporine (staurosporine is a non-specific, yet potent kinase inhibitor; 1 micromolar corresponds to staurosporine IC100). A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was a potent positive allosteric modulator of rat mGluR4 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Active' and a 'Score' of '100'.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence dose response cell-based counterscreening assay for agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): inhibition by S1P4-selective antagonist. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a test compound with S1P4 agonist activity is inhibited by an S1P4-selective antagonist. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. The presence of an S1P4-selective antagonist compound in the assay inhibits S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. In the presence of a test agonist compound, the S1P4 receptor will be stimulated, leading to an increase in well FRET. Compound was tested in triplicate using a 7-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 10 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 ug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, 370 nM S1P4-selective antagonist SR2-304 was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and SR2-304. Low_Control is defined as wells containing SR2-304. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 10 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 10 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100. There are no inactive compounds.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1539), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (PubChem AID 1703), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the EC10 NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactive compounds 80-0.

Description:  Inherited deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) can result in a potentially lethal disorder called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Several lines of evidence indicate that an elevated level of galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-p), the product of galactokinase (GALK), is a major, if not sole, pathogenic mechanism in patients with classic galactosemia. Therefore, finding inhibitors of GALK is a potential novel therapy for this inherent metabolic disease and is the long term goal of this project. Active compounds observed in the qHTS GALK assay (AID: 1868) were cherry picked and re-screened for validation. GALK (provided by Kent Lai) was assayed using ATP and D-(+)-Galactose (Sigma-Aldrich cat# G0750) as substrates. Promega Kinase-Glo Plus (cat# V3774) technology was used to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. Briefly, the Kinase-Glo Plus contains Ultra-Glo. luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the remaining ATP. Kinase reactions with and without GALK were used as negative and positive controls together with Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase CD45 inhibitor (EMD Bioscience cat# 540215) which is shown to inhibit GALK activity Three uL/well of ATP-buffer solution (35 uM ATP, 20mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner, solid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Compound and control solution (23 nL) was transferred to the assay plate using the Kalypsys 1536-pin tool apparatus. One uL/well GALK-galactose solution (5 nM GALK, 100 uM galactose, 20 mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well. After 1 hour of room temperature incubation, 4 uL Kinase-Glo Plus reagent was added for a final assay volume of 8 uL/well. Luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) after 2 min incubation using a 1 sec exposure time and 2x binning.

Description:  To characterize binding of small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERbeta, a series of dose-response curves were completed for compounds with suggested ERbeta binding ability in primary screening using a competitive binding approach using whole cells. This assay assesses the affinity of small molecules with unknown ERbeta binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERbeta in permeabilized whole cells expressing ERbeta-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind ERbeta will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with ERbeta-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructrions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Dose-response curves are arrayed across the plate in duplicate with low concentrations in columns 3 and 14 and increasing concentrations of compounds (in 1/2-log increments) in columns 4-11 and 15-22, respectively. Columns 12 and 13 contain untransfected cells. Sixteen unknown compounds per plate were assayed in dose-responses in this manner. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 100% binding E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using: %Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF where Sample MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from sample well and Negative Control MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from wells with vehicle (DMSO) control. These %Binding data were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression on a sigmoidal dose response model. Some dose response data converged with variable slopes (four parameter logistics equation) and some dose response data converged with Hill Slope set to 1 (three parameter logistics equation), see column entitled HILLSLOPE. Curve fit statistics reported concentration of compound at 50% effect (EC50, nanoM), low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, the Hill Slope, and the correlation coefficient (RSQR) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Reporting of EC50 estimates were made only for compound data that converged in Prism with a 95% confidence interval. Maximum EC50 reported was set at 10 microM or 10,000 nanoM. Any compound with estimate EC50 greater than this cutoff was noted with > in the ACTIVITY_QUALIFIER column. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves. A score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding of fluorescent ligand at the 10uM point of the dose-response curve, where: 0 = 70% < %Binding 10 = 50 < %Binding < 70% 20 = 30 < %Binding < 50% 30 = %Binding < 30% A score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the estimated EC50 value (in M), where: 0 = 10^-5 < EC50 10 = 10^-6 < EC50 < 10^-5 20 = 10^-7 < EC50 < 10^-6 30 = 10^-8 < EC50 < 10^-7 40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8 50 = EC50 < 10^-9 A score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the magnitude of the dose-response curve of E2-Alexa633 binding using: MAGNITUDE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where: 0 = MAGNITUDE < 30 or MAGNITUDE > 100 10 = 30 < MAGNITUDE < 45 20 = 45 < MAGNITUDE < 100 These three scoring parameters were summed to give the possible maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds were considered "Active" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was 50 or greater and given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "Non-Active" compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE less than 50 given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.

Description:  The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway  (ERK1/2 cascade) plays a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP, or by activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase as epidermal growth factor receptor. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high throughout screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To exclude the assay-related false positives, we used a biotinylated rabbit IgG to perform counter-screen. The biotinylated antibody mimics the phosphorylated ERK1/2 for bringing streptavidin coated beads and protein-A coated beads to a proximity range for the AlphaScreen detection. HEK293 cells stably expressing type-1 vasopressin receptor (V1b) were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium contained 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, non-essential amino acid, pyruvate and 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The aliquots of frozen cells were stored at -135C and used for the compound screening. All compounds were screened as titrations from 0.6 nM to 46 uM final concentration. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used to stimulate the ERK phosphorylation pathway. The ERK phosphorylation in cells was determined using an AlphaScreen assay kit provided by PerkinElmer. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (25 nM EGF). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. (1) Seed 4 ul/well of resuspended frozen HEK293 cells containing 2000 cells in white 1536-well plates for overnight with 1% FBS at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.6 nM to 46 uM. (3) Incubate at 37C for 30 min. (4) Dispense 0.5uL EGF (25 nM in final) (5) Incubate at 37C for 5 min. (6) Dispense 0.5uL of 1:2 diluted 5x lysis buffer. (7) Incubate at 37C for 10 min. (8) Dispense 1.5uL of mixture of activation buffer and reaction buffer with AlphaScreen beads (streptavidin donor beads and protein-A acceptor beads, 10 ng/well for each). (9) Incubate at room temperature for 5 hr. (10) Detect the assay plate in an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer) using the AlphaScreen detection mode.

Description:  Enterococcus faecalis HMGR converts mevalonate and coenzyme A to HMG-CoA using NADP as a cofactor. A product of this reaction, NADPH, absorbs strongly at 340 nm.  The rate of the reaction is measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm with a PerkinElmer Envision microplate reader.  This assay was chosen rather than the HMG-CoA reductase reaction because the substrates, mevalonate and coenzyme A, are less expensive and more stable than HMG-CoA.  NADP is also more stable than NADPH, making this a more robust assay for use in a HTS format.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The purpose of this assay was to screen for compounds that would reduce the observed assay rate, which would in theory be the result of the compound inhibiting the activity of the target enzyme, HMGR. A total of 197,000 compounds were screened at a final concentration of 10 uM. HMG-CoA Reductase Protocol for 384-well HTS Purified recombinant Enterococcus faecalis HMG-CoA reductase. Compound Dosing/Plating: Twenty five nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 384-well clear non-binding surface treated plates. This resulted in concentrations of 10 uM of compound in the assay.  Fifteen uL of HMG-CoA reductase reagent mix which included coenzyme A, NADP, and mevalonate in assay buffer was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 384-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 10 uL of HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 2 mM coenzyme A, 4 mM NADP, 4 mM mevalonate, and 15 ug/ml HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM KCl, 2% DMSO and 0.01% Tween 20). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 160 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns with 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the mevalonate had been left out (background).

Description:  Confirmation biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) Assay preparation was started by dispensing 2.5 ul per well of a solution containing 2 nM FAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) into a black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. Next, 35 nL of test compound from the MLSCN library (final nominal concentration of 7 uM, 0.7% final DMSO concentration) or positive and negative control (143 uM staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 ul of 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 10 uM ATP in kinase buffer. After 60 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 5 ul of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature. After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer). To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm. The inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicates wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound = Wells containing test compound LowControl = Wells containing DMSO HighControl = Wells containing 1 uM staurosporine (corresponding to staurosporine's IC100). The hit cutoff criterion from the primary HTS campaign was applied to this assay. Values for average % inhibition and standard deviation for each compound were generated. Compounds were determined to confirm activity if their average % inhibition value exceeded the hit cutoff from the primary HTS campaign, i.e. >18.78% inhibition. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes. Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others. However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs. This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal. Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. Compounds were tested at 30uM (fixed) in the presence of a submaximal concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) (~EC10) and evaluated for their ability to elevate the response to ACh in rM1- or hM5-expressing CHO cells using the primary calcium assay. Compounds eliciting a response less than approximately 40 %ACh Max in either or both cell line were scored as inactive (0).  Compounds eliciting a response between approximately 40 and 60 %ACh Max in either or both cell lines were scored as partially active (50).  Compounds eliciting a response greater than approximately 60 %ACh Max in either or both cell lines were considered fully active (100).

Description:  Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit GPR7 activity. Although GPR7 is naturally coupled to G&#945;i, which decreases cAMP levels upon activation, this assay employs a chimeric cell line that forces the receptor to use Gqi3, and therefore the assay readout is calcium release. In this assay HEK cells stably co-transfected with the human GPR7 receptor and G&#945;qi3 (hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as GPR7 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 0.625 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of GPR7 agonist (2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 180 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = [ 1 - ((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPW. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary Screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The PubChem Activity Score has been set to 100 for active compounds and 0 for inactive compounds.

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR.  The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform  was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  The relaxin hormone is involved in the variety of biological functions in normal tissues and diseases. The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary gland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin signaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through regulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis. Significantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung fibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human relaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive heart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic sclerosis. Upon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. cAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP increase is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists of the relaxin receptor, a THP1 cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit. This is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP1 receptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were lysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell lysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to a decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer only) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin). The EC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation 1536-well assay protocol for the THP1 RXFP1 cAMP assay: (1) Add 3 ul THP1 RXFP1 cell culture. 2000 cells/well in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (dispensed offline with MultiDrop Combi). (2) Incubate 16-24 hr at 37C, 5% CO2. (3) Add 1 ul 400uM Ro20174 in DPBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.005% Tween 20. (3) Add 23 nl compounds in DMSO solution. Final concentration was 0.5 - 58 uM. (4) Incubate 30 min at 37C, 5% CO2. (5) Add 1 ul cAMP-d2 in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (6) Add 1 ul anti-cAMP antibody-cryptate in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (7) Incubate 30 min at room temperature. (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=320 nm, Em1=615 nm and Em2=665 nm.

Description:  The classical pathway mediates specific antibody responses. The classical pathway is initiated by the binding of antibodies to cell surface antigens. Subsequent binding of the antibody to complement C1q subunits of C1 result in catalytically active C1s subunits. The two activated C1s subunits are then able to catalyze the assembly of the C3 convertase (complement C4b2a) from complements C2 and C4.(Ref. 1) The high-throughput screen on mixture plates for complement factor C1s inhibitors and single compound IC50 determination of active compounds has been reported earlier (AID 538 and AID 787). In this assay, we use ELISA, which can determine the activity of the classical pathway as a whole, to test the activity of hits from the C1s mixture screen.

Description:  Inherited deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) can result in a potentially lethal disorder called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Several lines of evidence indicate that an elevated level of galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-p), the product of galactokinase (GALK), is a major, if not sole, pathogenic mechanism in patients with classic galactosemia. Therefore, finding inhibitors of GALK is a potential novel therapy for this inherent metabolic disease and is the long term goal of this project. GALK (provided by the assay submitter) was assayed using ATP and D-(+)-Galactose (Sigma-Aldrich cat# G0750) as substrates [1]. Promega Kinase-Glo Plus (cat# V3774) technology was used to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. Briefly, the Kinase-Glo Plus contains Ultra-Glo [2] luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the remaining ATP. ATP-galactose solution (35 uM ATP, 100 uM galactose, 20mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase CD45 inhibitor (EMD Bioscience cat# 540215) which was shown to inhibit GALK, were used as a positive controls[1]. Three uL/well of ATP-buffer solution (35 uM ATP, 20mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration)  was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner, solid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Compound solution (23 nL) was transferred to the assay plate using the Kalypsys 1536-pin tool. One uL/well GALK-galactose solution (5 nM GALK, 100 uM galactose, 20 mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well.  After 1 hour of room temperature incubation, 4 uL Kinase-Glo Plus reagent was added for a final assay volume of 8 uL/ well. Luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) after 10 min incubation using a 1 sec exposure time and 2x binning.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-019) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932), were nonselective due to activation of NF-kappaB. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871). In this assay activation of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that stably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in NF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An activator will increase TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus activating the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that increase NF-kB activity are considered non-selective activators. The activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin, and 1 ug/mL puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The assay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 100% activation). A subset of wells received MG-132 (100 uM final nominal concentration in DMSO) to monitor that the assay was functioning properly. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration resulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  This assay is for testing chemical inhibitors of Rho kinase 2 (Rhok2) activity. The assay is based on ability of Rhok2 to phosphorylate a specific peptide sequence derived from its substrate - ribosomal protein S6 (amino acid residues 229-239). Rhok2 uses ATP as a donor of phosphate for the phosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay kit ("Kinase-Glo", Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Using this kit, residual amounts of ATP are measured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, through which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to produce luminescence. Luminescent signal is directly proportional to ATP concentration and inversely proportional to Rhok2 activity. This dose response assay was conducted in 1536 well plate format. Each concentration was tested nominally in triplicate.

Description:  Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) influences heart rate [1,2], coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity [3] and lymphocyte recirculation [2,4] through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors [5]. Subtype-selective modulators of S1P receptors will be of broad utility in understanding cell functions in vitro and vascular physiology in vivo, as well as de-convoluting the role of individual subtypes in cellular processes.  The S1P receptor 2 (S1P2), also known as endothelial differentiation sphingolipid G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (EDG5), signals through Gi, Gq and G12/13 pathways [6] and has been shown to inhibit cell migration in several cell types [7]. Additionally, many different malignant cells have been shown to overexpress S1P2. For example, S1P2 is expressed in melanoma cells [8] and is co-expressed together with S1P3 in breast cancer cells [9]. Moreover, S1P2 expression has also been found in glioma cells [10] and nine gastric cancer cell lines were shown to express S1P2 to varying degrees [11]. Taken together, these observations implicate S1P2 as a potential player in oncogenesis.  As no selective S1P2 agonist exists, the discovery of selective SIP2 agonists by high-throughput screening will be beneficial for uncovering the physiological and pathological roles of this S1P receptor subtype. A cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure activation of the CRE pathway. Under normal conditions, the cells have low CRE basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels.  Stimulation of the CRE pathway by an agonist induces transcription of the BLA gene in proportion to agonist concentration, resulting in increased BLA activity. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. Protocol Summary: This assay is a counterscreen for nonspecific activators of the cyclic AMP signaling pathway.  Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul (100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension were dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to the sample or control wells, respectively.   Next, 1.1 ul of forskolin were dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 2 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of PBS was dispensed into negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours.  After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: Percent Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)] Where: Well ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength. Negative control wells are defined as wells containing DMSO Positive control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in greater than 50 percent activation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 value was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 values less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent activation is observed. This calculation results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening Assay for Inhibitors of Wee1 Degradation" (PubChem AID 1321). The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a kinase negative mutant of Wee1 (Wee1K328M) fused to a luciferase reporter gene. As designed, compounds that increase Wee1K328M-luciferase stability and/or prevent its degradation will lead to increased well luminescence compared to untreated wells. Specifically, compounds that increase luminescence are considered Wee1 degradation inhibitors. Compounds were tested in triplicate. HeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture (PSN) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). HeLa cells were transiently transfected in T75 flasks by mixing 6 million cells with 29 micrograms of the Luc::Wee1K328M plasmid complexed with 87 ul of TransIT-LT1 reagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per mL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at -80 degrees C until needed. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compound (final nominal 5 micromolar concentration), DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration), or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  CRE beta-lactamase Assay Overview Using a beta-lactamase reporter-gene under control of cAMP responsive element, a cell-based assay [CellSensor(TM) CRE-bla CHO developed by Invitrogen Corp.] was used to measure forskolin-induced signaling. The selected compounds were measured for their ability to modulate positively the action of EC10 NKH 477, a water soluble forskolin, on reporter gene activity. Compounds were screened in a titration series in 1536-well format. Positive modulators were identified based on the AC50 values derived from the screening data. 2000 cells/5uL in Opti-MEM medium containing 0.5% dialyzed FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES was dispensed into 1536-well plates and cells were cultured at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. Next day 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, and 1uL of EC10 level of NKH 477, or EC100 level of IBMX, a PDE inhibitor, in the present of NKH 477, or assay medium was added. And then the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 3 hours. 1 uL of CCF4-dye mixture was added to each well. After incubated at room temperature for 2 hours the plates were measured on an EnVision plate reader at Excitation 405nm, Emission1=460nm and Emission 2=530nm. The %Activity was determined from the ratio of 460nm/530nm.

Description:  The PKD HTS assay was developed and run at the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Screening Center (PMLSC) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)(1R03DA24898-01). Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases targeted by diacylglycerol. It regulates many fundamental cell functions including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and protein trafficking, and plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer in multiple organ systems. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of PKD are not clearly understood, and the role of PKD in cancer and other diseases has not been fully defined. This is partly due to the lack of effective pharmacological tools that specifically target PKD in normal cellular processes and in pathological conditions. The immediate goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an IMAP-based fluorescent polarization (FP) assay for high throughput screening (HTS) of PKD inhibitors. The assay we are proposing is in a 384-well, small volume format and has been adapted for high throughput screening. The objective is to discover novel potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of PKD that will be helpful in understanding the biological relevance of PKD and have the potential for long-term therapeutic application. Hits identified from screening the 57K library (second HTS campign) were subjected to an assay binding interference assay.

Description:  Shiga toxin (Stx) is released by certain strains of E. coli and is associated with food-borne gastroenteritis. In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain injury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein synthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that employed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the proteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly diminished luciferase translation. Stx inhibitors permit production of the luciferase reporter and result in increased luminescence Six million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced and the cells infected with 3 x109 plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well Shiga toxin (10ng/mL final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After addition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  6uL of HeLa miR-21-FLuc cells in assay buffer (DMEM, Invitrogen #21063-029; 10% FBS, HyClone #SH30071.03) were dispensed at 2000cells/well (3.3 x 105 cells/mL) into Greiner solid-white TC-treated 1536-well plates using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated for one hour at 37 degree Celsius, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. These assay plates were then treated with 23nL of compound or DMSO using a Kalypsys pin tool, which allows for delivery of a 24-point titration of each compound to the assay plate, with a final compound concentration ranging from approximately 40uM to 5pM. Assay plates were then incubated for 48 hours. After incubation, plates were allowed to come to RT for one hour prior to delivery of 3uL of 3X luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minute incubation to allow for cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using a ViewLux CCD imager (PerkinElmer), with an average exposure time of 2-12 seconds.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. This assay was conducted with analogs of compounds designated as active in the confirmation and counter screens.  These compounds were evaluated based on % ATPase activity. Those showing <=40% ATPase activity were deemed sufficiently active for continuation to the secondary screen in BSC1 (ATCC CCL-26) cells. Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown, and plated in 96-well microplates in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS.  Compounds were added to the cells, followed by 100 TCID50 units of SV40 virus, and the plates were incubated for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. MAL211B was used as a positive control.  Additional wells were included to evaluate the effects of the same concentrations of compounds in the absence of virus.  At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal in the no virus wells.  Increased cell viability in the virus wells indicates effective compounds.  Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  Compounds that show less than 50% toxicity at concentration twice or greater than that of the TAg-IC50 will be considered as active. Data Analysis: 8 cell control wells (- virus) and 8 infected wells (cells + virus) per plate were used to calculate drug efficacy value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. Efficacy was performed in triplicate on each plate, and cytoxicity was performed in duplicate. Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) of cell viability and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - virus control)/(cell control - virus control). From these curves IC50 values were calculated.

Description:        To identify novel compounds that act as effective ER-alpha coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay has been developed in a 384 well format.  This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with the LBD of ER-alpha, which is induced in the presence of an agonist like estradiol, brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.  Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays. 1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add 0.6 uL of library compound (0.5 or 1.5 mM stock in DMSO with a final concentration of 15 or 45 uM) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-alpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. 3. Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives.

Description:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease was first characterized by Jean-Martin Charcot and Pierre Marie in France and, independently, by Howard Henry Tooth in England in 1886. CMT is one of the most common inherited neurological diseases, affecting about 125,000 Americans. CMT patients typically exhibit muscle atrophy in the extremities and sensory loss. The most common cause of CMT is known as CMT1A, and is caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene, leading to over-expression of this protein. PMP22 is a glycosylated intrinsic membrane protein accounting for 2-5% of the myelin protein content and over-expression leads to demyelination and subsequently axonal loss. A cell-based assay for PMP22 expression modulation was developed by Drs. Ned Mantei and Ueli Suter on behalf of the CMTA. This assay employs a mouse Schwann cell line, MSC80, that was engineered to have the mouse Pmp22 promoter driving expression of a green light-emitting click beetle luciferase (CBG68; Chroma-Gl developed by Promega Corp).  A red light-emitting click beetle luciferase (CBR; developed by Promega Corp: CBG68 and CBR differ by only  a few amino acids within the D-luciferin binding pocket) under control of the EF-alpha promoter is also stably expressed in the same cells for use as an internal control for nonspecific promoter- or reporter-based effects. Cells were seeded in white solid 1536-well plates at between 500-750 cells/4uL in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, w/o phenol red. After overnight incubation at 37 degree Celsius/5% C02, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, followed by 24h-incubation at 37 degree Celsius/5% C02. Then 4 uL Chroma-Glo luminescent substrate mix (Promega) was added to each well. Luminescence was measured on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a 540/25 nm filter for green luminescence and a 618/8 nm filter for red luminescence. The green and red luminescent signals were corrected for red and green luminescence filter overlap using filter calibration constants (determined using control cell lines expressing either the green or red CBLuc reporters). The %Activity was determined from the ratio of corrected green/red luminescent values. Green luminescent and ratio %Activity was determined by normalizing to the signal between of untreated cells (0% Activity) Concentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the green luminescence (PMP22 promoter driven expression) and the red luminescence (control promoter) as well as the calculated ratio. The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871) were nonselective due to activation of NF-kappaB. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932). In this assay activation of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that stably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in NF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An activator will increase TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus activating the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that activate NF-kB activity are considered non-selective activators. The activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin and 1 microgram/mL of puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The assay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 100% activation). A subset of wells received MG-132 (100 uM final nominal concentration in DMSO) to monitor that the assay was functioning properly. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration resulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma is a transcription factor that has a central role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been implicated in graft versus host disease, autoimmune disease and asthma. ROR gamma is induced in naive T helper cells in the presence of TGF-beta combined with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23, and thereafter directs the expression of the Th17 lineage cytokines. To study the mechanism of action of ROR gamma, an insect cell-based assay was screened. This Drosophila Schneider cell line was stably transfected with two vectors: a gene expressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and ROR gamma transactivation domain under the control of the metallothionine promoter and a Photinus luciferase reporter regulated by the Gal4 binding site enhancer, UAS. The addition of copper to the medium induced expression of the Gal4-ROR gamma fusion that subsequently induced the UAS-luciferase reporter. Small molecule inhibitors of ROR gamma activity are detected by a decrease in luciferase reporter activity. For screening, 600 cells in 4 uL/well were dispensed into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature, and 1 uL/well copper sulfate (700 uM final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 20 hr at ambient temperature. After addition of 1.5 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in an uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for antagonists of the APJ receptor. This AT1 antagonist assay utilizes the same luminescent b-Arrestin-based assay readout as the uHTS APJ primary assay. In both assays we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the KOR1 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLin. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. This assay is a follow-up to "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ receptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2521. A.

Description:  Counterscreen for antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GalR2): a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of beta-lactamase activity Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin). Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of 1536-well plates (2000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 25 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Following the incubation, the assay was started by dispensing 21 nL of test compound in DMSO (4 uM final nominal concentration; 0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) to the appropriate wells. Then, 1 ul of thapsigargin in 2% BSA (final concentration of 500 nM, a concentration that resulted in approximately 100% activity) was dispensed to sample field wells. Next, the high control (500 nM thapsigargin in 2% BSA) and low control (2% BSA) were dispensed to the appropriate control wells and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 ul was added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at 25 degrees C, well fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 1 ul of 2% BSA in PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 1 ul of 2.5 uM thapsigargin in 2% BSA. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score 0.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (PubChem AID 1700), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (AID 1834), and that were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for KLF5 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line in triplicate" (AID 1905). This cell-based reporter assay employs a human DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line that is stably transfected with a plasmid containing 2.0 kb of the human KLF5 promoter used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p). Cells are seeded in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for one day, followed by incubation with test compounds. Luciferase activity is monitored using a luminescent detection reagent, which contains the luciferase substrate D-luciferin that releases light energy upon conversion to oxyluciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and oxygen. As designed, compounds that inhibit KLF5 expression will reduce the activity of the KLF5 promoter, thereby reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and luciferase protein levels, resulting in decreased conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, and reduced well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. The DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 800 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 2500 cells in a 5 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above except without geneticin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or LY294002 (200 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 27 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds. The purpose of this assay is to test a set of synthesized compounds for S1P4 agonist activity. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 ug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, 100 ug/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 6 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 22 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Selected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Score and Outcome: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. All active compounds were ranked by potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-76, and for inactive compounds 60-0.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release. Gamma-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD1-mediated NF-kB pathway. NOD1 specifically detects Gamma-Tri-DAP, a tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kB pathway. Here we used GM-Tri-DAP to induce IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS luminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 1578) and followed up in "SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1" )AID 2072) to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. 1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1 2. GM-Tri-DAP (Sigma) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. GM-Tri-DAP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed. 5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve analysis.

Description:  Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  This high-content imaging assay was used as a counter screen for hits originally identified in a high-content screen for antagonists of the GPR35 receptor "Image-based HTS for Selective Antagonists of GPR35" (AID 2058) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPR55 activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits and further into endosomal vesicles.  This arrestin-GFP redistribution is measured as increased local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR55 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 100ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Agonist Working Solution: Lysophosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar #850090P, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 50uM in water. 5) Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO (for positive control wells: no agonist will be added to mimic 100% inhibition of agonist-mediated response; for negative control wells: LPI agonist will be added to mimic 0% inhibition of agonist-mediated response). 6) Test Compounds Working Solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates were incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum was removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on an ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Control working solution was added to columns 1 and 24 representing positive control wells by using 0 uM agonist to mimick 100% inhibition. c. Control working solution was added to columns 2 and 23 representing negative control wells. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve 0.3% final concentration. 5) Plates were pre-incubated with compounds for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) After 30 minutes, 5 ul of the agonist (50 uM LPI) working solution was added to the entire plate except column 1 and 24 for a final agonist concentration of 5 uM. 7) Plates were incubated for 75 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  8) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  9) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 10) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 11) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 12) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1)   Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: 20x 0.45 NA air objective   Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels   2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters   4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION   Threshold Adjustment:     1.5   Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7   Minimum Nuclear Area:     0   Minimum Nuclear Contrast:    0.1  CYTOPLASM DETECTION   Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:   0.45   Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.15 SPOT DETECTION  Spot Minimum Distance    3  Spot Peak Radius     0 Spot Reference Radius    2  Spot Minimum Contrast    0.25  Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   1 3) Metrics calculated from NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count (NumberofCellsAnalyzed), Nuclei Area (AreaoftheNucleus), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei (TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus), Average Intensity of the Nuclei (AverageIntensityoftheNucleus) GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm (TotalCytoplasmIntensity), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots (TotalSpotIntensity), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities (RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity), Number of Spots per Cell (AverageSpotsPerCell), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation (PercentagePositiveCells) 4) The "AverageSpotsPerCell" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. IC50 values were calculated using CBIS (ChemInnovations) software employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of a powder sample of a compound identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107). In this assay, U-2OS cells are incubated with test compound, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in a 7-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 20 uM. Protocol Summary: This assay was started by dispensing U-2OS cells in McCoy's 5A medium plus 10% FBS, penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin 100 ug/ml (20 uL, 4 x 10E3 cells/well) into the wells of a 384-well plate. Eight 1:3 serial dilutions of compound (100 uM in growth media) were made. 5 uL of diluted compound or media were added to wells, giving final compound concentrations of 0-20 uM. The plate was incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator for 24 hours, then equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes. 25 uL CellTitre-Glo reagent was added to each well, followed by incubation of the plate in the dark for 10 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the Envision plate reader. The % growth inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: % Growth Inhibition = ( MedianRFU_High_Control - RFU_Test_Compound ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing cells treated with media only (no compound). Low_Control is defined as wells containing no cells (media only). Percent growth inhibition was plotted against the log of the compound concentration. The CC50 is reported as "> X uM" (where X = the highest concentration tested for which < 50% growth inhibition was observed). PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with a CC50 value of less than 10uM were considered active (cytotoxic). Compounds with a CC50 value greater than 10uM were considered inactive (non-cytotoxic). The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds. List of Reagents: U-2OS cells (ATCC, part HTB-96) McCoy's 5A Medium (Invitrogen, part 16600-082) FBS (Invitrogen, part 26140-079) Penicillin / Streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122) Cell Titer-Glo (Promega, part G7572) 384-well plates (Corning 3570)

Description:  The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)" (AID 1789), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)" (AID 1846). This assay monitors the ability of compounds to inhibit the refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase by Hsp90 protein (7, 8). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate is the source of Hsp90 protein. In this assay, denatured luciferase enzyme is incubated with the cell lysate in the presence of test compounds. As designed, compounds that inhibit Hsp90 activity will prevent luciferase renaturation and activity, leading to a decrease in well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 59 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay, 3.75 microliters of 8.3% rabbit reticulocyte lysate were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, geldanamycin (60 micromolar final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1.25 microliters of 6.29 micrograms/mL denatured luciferase solution containing 12 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 0.806 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase in Assay Buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 375 mM KCl) into all wells. After 3 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS were added to each well. Next, plates were incubated for 10 minutes and well luminescence was read on the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD2 combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007). MDP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD2-mediated NF-kB pathway. Nod2 is a general sensor of peptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria (Girardin,2003). Here we used MDP to promote IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS luminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 1578) and followed up in "SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 2072) to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Protocol:  1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD2 2. MDP-LD (Invivogen) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. MDP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed. 5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve analysis.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M2/Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca. EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). None of the compounds were active against human M2/Gqi5 in the calcium flux assay at a compound concentration of 30uM. All compounds were assigned and 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Shiga toxin (Stx) is released by certain strains of E. coli and is associated with food-borne gastroenteritis. In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain injury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein synthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that employed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the proteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly diminished luciferase translation. A counterscreen assay was used to identify nonspecific compounds that inhibit protein synthesis independent of Stx action. Cycloheximide (Chx) readily diffuses into cells and immediately blocks protein synthesis in the absence of Stx. Stx actives that are active in the Chx assay are thus nonspecific compounds that stabilize luciferase activity.  Six million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced and the cells infected with 3 x109  plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well cyclohemixide (1 ug/mL final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After addition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor beta(CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "Identification of compounds inhibiting the binding between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb-SMMHC via a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay"(AID 1438) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Assay 1438 was a counterscreen for the primary screening assay, AID 1434.  This was accomplished by using a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the TR-FRET signal will be abated. Assay materials: 1) His6-tagged Runt domain of Runx (CBFa) and Venus-CBFb-SMMHC were provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA). 2) Tb-labeled anti-His antibody was purchased from Invitrogen 3) Fluorescent CBFa/b complex working solution: 125 nM Runx-His6 (CBFa), 62.5 nM Venus-CBFb-SMMHC, 1.25 nM Tb-labeled anti-His antibody in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM K2SO4, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, and 0.0125% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1h. 4) Positive control (PC) solution contained untagged CBFb-SMMHC added at 1.25 uM concentration to the CBFa/b working solution Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were 2-fold serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.  2) 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 3) 16 ul of CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 24 of a black 384-well plate (Greiner #784076) 4) 16 ul of positive control is added to columns 1 and 2. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) The plate is read on a BMG Pherastar using a Lanthascreen filter set: 337ex, 520em and 490em 7) TR-FRET is determined as the ratio of 520/490 signals

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation by the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and was assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration, 0.1 nM pyruvate kinase, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Cambrex) was added, the plates centrifuged, and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme or 110 uM N-methyl-2,3-diphenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-imine; CID: 682802; LOPAC-S-4063). To monitor activation, 0.3 nM pyruvate kinase was included in one control column.

Description:  Shiga toxin (Stx) is released by certain strains of E. coli and is associated with food-borne gastroenteritis. In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain injury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein synthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that employed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the proteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly diminished luciferase translation. Stx inhibitors permit production of the luciferase reporter and result in increased luminescence. Six million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced and the cells infected with 3 x10e9 plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well Shiga toxin (10ng/mL final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After addition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine the cytotoxicity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1321), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1410). The assay employs the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. As designed, cytotoxic compounds will reduce viable cell numbers and ATP levels, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were assayed in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. HeLa cells were routinely cultured in T175 flasks in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen-strep-neo antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, HeLa cells were plated at 500 cells per well in 1536-well plates in 5 microliters of growth media.  Plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity. Next, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were added to the appropriate wells.  Plates were then placed back in the incubator for 20 hours. After incubation, 5 ul of CellTiter-Glo reagent were added to each well, and the plates were allowed to incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. Next, well luminescence was measured for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader. The percent cytotoxicity was expressed relative to wells containing media only (100%) and wells containing cells treated with DMSO only (0%).

Description:  Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonism activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1510). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. Any compound that exhibited a percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 23 and active compounds range of activity score is 23 to 100.

Description:  Memories persist for different lengths of time, from seconds or minutes to a lifetime. There are two kinds of memory: short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). STM lasts for minutes to hours, which maybe mediated by modifications of molecules involved in synaptic functions. LTM lasts for days or longer, and may be due to the formation of new synapses or restructuring of existing synapses. LTM, but not STM, requires gene transcription and synthesis of proteins. CREB (cyclic-AMP Responsive Element Binding Protein) is one of the candidates plays an important role for enhancement of some types of LTM. CREB, a family of transcription factors, regulates the transcription of genes containing cAMP Responsive Elements (CRE). CRE is a nucleotide sequence often found in the promoter regions of genes that are binding sites for CREB. Using a beta-lactamase reporter-gene under control of cAMP responsive element, a cell-based assay [CellSensor(TM) CRE-bla CHO developed by Invitrogen Corp.] was used to measure forskolin-induced signaling. Library compounds were measured for their ability to modulate positively or negatively the action of EC10 NKH 477, a water soluble forskolin, on reporter gene activity. Compounds were screened in a titration series in 1536-well format. Positive and negative modulators were identified based on the AC50 values derived from the screening data. 2000 cells/5uL in Opti-MEM medium containing 0.5% dialyzed FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES was dispensed into 1536-well plates and cells were cultured at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. Next day 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, and 1uL of EC10 level of NKH 477, or EC100 level of IBMX, a PDE inhibitor, in the present of NKH 477, or assay medium was added. And then the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 3 hours. 1 uL of CCF4-dye mixture was added to each well. After incubated at room temperature for 2 hours the plates were measured on an EnVision plate reader at Excitation 405nm, Emission1=460nm and Emission 2=530nm. The %Activity was determined from the ratio of 460nm/530nm.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), working with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), control the phosphorylation state of many proteins in the signal transduction pathways. HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate methyl-fluorescein from 3-O-methylflyorescein phosphate (OMFP). 1)HePTP protein was provided by Dr. Mustelin (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2) Assay Buffer: 50mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 1mM DTT, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% Tween-20 3) 3-O-Methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) cyclohexylammonium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, M2629) Dose response protocol: 1) Dispense 10 ul of 600 uM OMFP in assay buffer into all columns of black 384-well small-volume Greiner plates (786076) 2) Dispense 10 uL of assay buffer in columns 1-2. 3) Using Labcyte Echo550, dispense 200 nL of serially diluted compounds to columns 3-22 and DMSO to columns 1-2 and 23-24. Final concentration of DMSO was 1 % 4) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi, dispense 10 uL of 3 nM HePTP working solution to wells in columns 3 through 24. 5) Incubate lidded plate for 30 min. at room temp. 6) Read plate on M5 plate reader in fluorescence mode (Ex: 480nm, Em: 520nm)

Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP2D6 to measure the demethylation of ethylene glycol ester of luciferin 6' methyl ether (Luciferin-ME EGE; luciferin detection buffer) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection reagent. Luciferin-ME EGE concentration in the assay was equal to its Km for CYP2D6. Inhibitors and some substrates limit the production of luciferin, and decrease measured luminescence. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 5nM CYP2D6, 30uM Luciferin-ME EGE, 100mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at room temperature. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted luciferin detection buffer. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents and further information can be found at http://www.promega.com/tbs/tb325/tb325.pdf. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (1.43 uM quinidine).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-M1)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-M1 and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes. Data were normalized to the uninhibited controls.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted pyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to be crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications included functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the 3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to the fully unsaturated pyrazole. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871). In this assay activation of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1-luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 potentiator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing luminescence. The STAT1 potentiator and antagonist confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, or DMSO (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to sample and High Control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay uses an orthogonal technique to identify those compounds specifically interacting with the target protein. NMR samples for the saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments contained 2.5uM  menin solution in 50 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM NaCl,  1mM DTT, pH= 7.5, with 5% of D2O, final volume 150 uL. The compounds were added as stock solutions in DMSO to final 100 uM concentration and 5% DMSO. All NMR experiments were recorded using 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer at 25C. Samples for the competition STD experiments contained additional MBM1 peptide at final concentration of 25 uM and the measurements were carried out is the same way as described above for STD experiments.

Description:  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small (~20-25 nucleotides), nonprotein-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional repression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Estimated to be involved in the regulation of 30% of all protein-coding mRNAs, miRNAs play a significant role in many biological processes including cellular differentiation and tissue development. Not surprisingly, miRNAs have been found to be oncogenic or tumor suppressive, with altered miRNA expression levels associated with human cancers. The miRNA miR-21 has been found to be expressed in most human tissues, and its overexpression has been associated with a variety of human tumors. miR-21 has been shown to be anti-apoptotic: knock-down of miR-21 in a glioblastoma cell line was found to activate caspases and lead to apoptosis. Identification of small molecules that modulate miR-21 specifically, or miRNAs generally, would prove useful as tools to better understand miRNA biogenesis and mRNA regulation by miRNAs. Of special interest are compounds that specifically inhibit miR-21, and a cell-based firefly luciferase reporter gene assay optimized for 1536-well format quantitative HTS (qHTS) has been developed in an effort to identify such compounds. HeLa cells stably expressing firefly luciferase (FLuc) under the control of a CMV promoter (upstream) and a miR-21 binding sequence directly downstream of the gene. These cells endogenously express miR-21. Control compounds used were compound C3 (provided by collaborator), N6-phenyladenosine (MP Biomedicals, 0215379625), and DMSO.  6uL of HeLa miR-21-FLuc cells in assay buffer (DMEM, Invitrogen #21063-029; 10% FBS, HyClone #SH30071.03) were dispensed at 2000cells/well (3.3 x 105 cells/mL) into Greiner solid-white TC-treated 1536-well plates using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated for one hour at 37 degree Celsius, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. These assay plates were then treated with 23nL of compound or DMSO using a Kalypsys pin tool, which allows for delivery of a 24-point titration of each compound to the assay plate, with a final compound concentration ranging from approximately 40uM to 5pM. Assay plates were then incubated for 48 hours. After incubation, plates were allowed to come to RT for one hour prior to delivery of 3uL of 3X luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minute incubation to allow for cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using a ViewLux CCD imager (PerkinElmer), with an average exposure time of 2-12 seconds.

Description:  Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized analogues. Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonist dose response of synthesized compounds. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22 micromolar final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem activity score for active compounds is 100-1, there are no inactives.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play vital roles in numerous cellular processes and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases, ranging from cancer to cardiovascular, immunological, infectious, neurological, and metabolic diseases. The Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) PTP is a dual-specific Erk and Jnk phosphatase, the loss of which causes specific cell cycle arrest in HeLa carcinoma cells, suggesting that VHR inhibition may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer cells without detrimental effects on normal cells. Recent studies by collaborators and us suggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) is a classical pTyr-specific phosphatase.  HePTP shares a physiological substrate with VHR, namely the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2, and therefore was chosen to assess the selectivity of the VHR1 inhibitors reported in AID 2004. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of an inhibitor. The HePTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of compound was assayed at 30 degree celsius in a 60 ul 96-well format reaction system in 150 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0 assay buffer having an ionic strength of 150 mM (adjusted with NaCl) and containing 1 mM DTT and 5% DMSO.  With a HePTP concentration of 1 nM, and at various concentrations of the compound (between 1 nM and 100 uM), the initial rate at 14 uM DiFMUP concentration (Km value) was determined using a FLx800 micro plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), an excitation wave length of 360 nm and measuring the emission of the fluorescent reaction product 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (DiFMU) at 460 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme.  The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 1 using the software GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Vi/V0 = IC50/(IC50 + [I]) (Eq. 1) In this case, Vi is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I], V0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki[S]/Km.

Description:  Measurement of TR-FRET detection format artefact in the screen for agonists of steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). This assay complements a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 1032). Since the positive control agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) activity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-2/PPARgamma complex, a sample well that exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-2/PPARgamma assay most likely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to identify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may have an erroneous activity assignment in AID 1032. This assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-2 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in sample well measured immediately after addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact. Prior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with five ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 ug/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC-2 protein [aa 624-829].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was started by dispensing forty nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000 Where,  I671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617 nm. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.  Any compound that exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible TR-FRET artefact.

Description:  In this counterscreen, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene, but lacking the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion that was present in the primary screening cell line (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to off target effects. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep(Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well.  Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]).  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the pGL-3 LUC gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL compound, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.  The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 731).  Additionally, compounds selected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation value (compared to AID 731) in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by PPARgamma," (PubChem AID 631) and "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by PPARgamma," (PubChem AID 1032). This assay tests the ability of compounds to increase the interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-3 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  Compounds that promote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist (LP-4) is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was not a positive allosteric modulator of rat mGluR7 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Calpains are ubiquitous, calcium-activated cysteine proteases involved in both physiological and pathological cellular functions. The two major forms, u-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain II), are activated by micromolar and millimolar calcium concentrations, respectively.  A current and well-supported hypothesis is that cellular injury leads to elevated intracellular calcium and provokes the pathologic activation of calpains. Activation of calpains is believed to be responsible for the cell death and axonal degeneration seen in many acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke, spinal cord and head injuries, and peripheral neuropathies.  Calpain activation leads to degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton, and inhibition of calpains prevents axonal degeneration. Despite the importance of calpains in the pathogenesis of axonal degeneration in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, calpains have not been subjected to a systematic small-molecule screen.  We have developed a fluorescent enzyme activity assay in 1536-well format to identify small molecule inhibitors of calpain II, the isoform most likely to be involved in axonal degeneration.  This end-point assay measures the calpain II-dependent hydrolysis of a self-quenching fluorescent calpain II peptide substrate.  Fluorescence intensity (ex. 360 nm and em. 490 nm) is detected with an EnVision plate reader and is proportional to calpain II activity.  Assay Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM cysteine, 5mM CaCl2, 1mM DTT) Purified calpain II (Calbiochem cat # 208715) Fluorogenic calpain II peptide substrate (Calbiochem cat# 208771) Positive control calpain II inhibitor (AK295 peptide, provided by assay PI) 1. Add 4 ul Assay Buffer to all wells. 2. Transfer 0.1 ul of stock compounds to appropriate wells. 3. Add 1 ul of 1mM AK295 control compound to appropriate positive control wells. 4. Dispense 1 ul of ice cold calpain-2 (diluted 1:100 (42nM) in Assay Buffer). 5. Dispense 1 ul of Calpain Substrate III (reconstituted in 500 ul Assay Buffer (stock solution) then diluted 1:20 (15uM) in Assay Buffer). 6. Incubate reaction mixture for 30 minutes. 7. Read plate @ excitation of 360 nm and emission @ 490 nm. Data analysis - All data were normalized to plate controls using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  PubChem Activity Score - Pct Inhibition was rounded to 0 decimal places.  Pct Inhibitions above 100 were set to 100, and those below 0 were set to 0. PubChem Activity Outcome - Compounds with >= 50% inhibition were marked as active, all others were marked as inactive.

Description:  This cell based assay utilized a cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG) as a biosensor for cAMP induction. HEK 293 cells stably expressing the modified CNG were purchased from BD biosciences (http://www.atto.com/products/actone/features_benefits.shtml) . Stimulation of cAMP production causes the CNG to open and subsequent membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent membrane potential dye (BD biosciences) was utilized to detect cAMP stimulation in cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 250 ug/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1 ug/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen) at 37C in 5% CO2.  This assay was used as a counterscreen to "qHTS Assay for Agonists of the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor", to control for compounds signaling through endogenous receptors and other targets of HEK 293 cells. High Throughput Screening. Freshly passaged cells were dispensed into 1536-well assay plates at 4 ul/well in DMEM containing phenol red (Invitrogen), 10% FCS (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 20 to 36 hrs before the robotic screening. The screen was initiated by addition of 4 ul/well membrane potential dye containing 100 uM RO 20-1724 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 60 min incubation at room temperature to allow for dye equilibration across the cell membrane. 23 nl/well compound or control was then added to the assay plates, which were incubated for additional 30 min before reading a Envision fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in bottom-read mode for fluorescence intensity (emission at 590 nm).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme).

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. The purpose of this experiment was to test compounds of interest for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding at the rat M4 muscarinic receptor. Competition binding assays were carried out essentially as described in with 25 mg of membrane protein prepared from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and 0.1nM [3H]-N-methylscopolamine (GE Healthcare) in a final volume of 1mL.  Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mM atropine.   A full atropine CRC was determined as a positive control. The compounds did not affect binding of the orthosteric ligand [3H]-NMS suggesting an allosteric modulation for the lead compounds. 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as "0'.

Description:  Fluorescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7)" (AID 1861). Although GPR7 is naturally coupled to G&#945;i, which decreases cAMP levels upon activation, this assay employs a chimeric cell line that forces the receptor to use Gqi3, and therefore the assay readout is calcium release. In this assay HEK cells stably co-transfected with the human GPR7 receptor and G&#945;qi3 (hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as GPR7 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 0.625 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of GPR7 agonist (2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 180 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPW. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the confirmation screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-23, for inactive 23-0.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-025) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  This PMA/Ionomycin induced NF-kB luciferase assay in 293-NF-kB-luc stable cells was developed and performed for the purpose of confirmation of the hits in the luciferase gene driven primary screening such as AID 465. Antigen receptor induced NF-kB pathway is initiated by Protein Kinase C (PKC)-theta and PKC-beta, respectively [Thome, 2004]. To verify the primary hits which inhibit antigen receptor induced NF-kB pathway, we used phorbol ester (phorbol myristic acetate [PMA]) and Ca2+-ionophore Ionomycin to achieve PKC activation, mimicking the initiating event in the antigen receptor pathway. We used HEK293 epithelial cells, in which it has previously been shown by siRNA-mediated gene silencing and transfection of dominant-negative mutants that PMA/Ionomycin-induced NF-kB activation is dependent on Carma1 (Bimp3) . Bcl-10, and Paracaspase (MALT) [McAllister-Lucas, 2001; Ruefli-Brasse, 2003; Ruland, 2001; Zhao, 2004]. HEK293 were stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by a NF-kB responsive promoter, and the responsiveness of this integrated promoter to various NF-kB inducing stimuli was confirmed. Materials: 1. 293- NF-kB-luc stable cells 2. PMA/Ionomycin (Sigma) 3. BriteLite kit for detection of firefly luciferase (Perkin-Elmer) 4. Luminometor (LJL biosystem) Protocol: 1. 293-NF-kB-Luc cells (10 (4) cells in 90 uL medium) were seeded in 96-well white plates for overnight. 2. Compounds were diluted in culture medium and 5 uL was added into the cells to reach desired final concentrations 3. 2 h later, 5 uL PMA/Ino (200 ng/ml) was added (final concentration = 10 ng/ml) and cells were treated for another 16 h. 4. 50 uL BriteLite solution was added into each well and luminescence was read using a luminometor. 5. The luminescence of cells treated by PMA/Ion was set to 100% and the data of each compound were processed and presented as the percentage of control.

Description:  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for drug discovery. The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)-protein family has important roles in GPCR signal transduction. RGS proteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signaling regulatory elements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signaling; however, some also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS inhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional specificity.  The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated distributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system disorders. Inhibitors of the RGS:GPCR interaction should prove useful as small molecule tools in this research field. A complex of Gai1 and fluorescently labeled G-alpha-binding peptide (the "GoLoco motif") derived from RGS12 is incubated with library members. Inhibitors of the binding are detected by a decrease in the fluorescence polarization (FP) of the fluorophore. Assay Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM GDP (prepared fresh), and 0.05% NP40 at pH 7.5. Controls: 15 nM Rhodamine labeled peptide dispensed into columns 3 and 4 to generate negative control (full inhibition of binding, -100 % activity). Four uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid-bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager using BODIPY for the rhodamine-labeled decapeptide probe. During dispense, reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath and all liquid lines were covered with aluminum foil to minimize probe and protein degradation. All screening operations were performed on a Kalypsys robotic system (Kalypsys, Inc., San Diego, CA) containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 anthropomorphic robotic arms.

Description:  The relaxin hormone is involved in the variety of biological functions in normal tissues and diseases. The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary gland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin signaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through regulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis. Significantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung fibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human relaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive heart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic sclerosis. Upon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. cAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP increase is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists of the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit. This is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP1 receptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were lysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell lysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to a decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer only) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin). The EC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation 1536-well assay protocol for the HEK293 RXFP1 cAMP assay: (1) Add 3 ul HEK293 RXFP1 cell culture. 2000 cells/well in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (dispensed offline with MultiDrop Combi). (2) Incubate 16-24 hr at 37C, 5% CO2. (3) Add 1 ul 400uM Ro20174 in DPBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.005% Tween 20. (3) Add 23 nl compounds in DMSO solution. Final concentration was 0.5 - 58 uM. (4) Incubate 30 min at 37C, 5% CO2. (5) Add 1 ul cAMP-d2 in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (6) Add 1 ul anti-cAMP antibody-cryptate in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (7) Incubate 30 min at room temperature. (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=320 nm, Em1=615 nm and Em2=665 nm.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M3 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca. EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope).  Compound dose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for compounds with EC50 < 1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50 > 1uM. All other compounds were assigned as 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Core Binding Factor (CBF) abnormalities are associated with 20-25% of all acute myeloid leukemias (AML), of which 5-10% are further sub classified as acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia,  also known as M4Eo in the FAB classification scheme.  This subtype of leukemia is usually associated with chromosome 16 inversion (p13:q22).  Chromosome 16 inversion results in formation of the fusion oncogene CBFB-MYH11, which encodes the fusion protein CBF-beta-SMMHC.  This fusion protein binds to RUNX1 (AML1) with high affinity and dominantly inhibits RUNX1 function preventing definitive hematopoiesis. It has been hypothesized that the interference of CBF-beta and RUNX1 binding could have therapeutic implications for patients with CBF mediated leukemias. We developed a CBF-beta and RUNX1 binding assay in AlphaScreenTM format and optimized it for high throughput screening to search for inhibitors.  The goal of this project is to screen MLPCN's compound collection (MLSMR) for identifying the inhibitors of the interaction between CBF-beta and RUNX1 proteins as research probes. If these probes work well in the animal models, the ultimate goal of this project is to development a new drug treatment for this disease. This assay can not be used to assess how apparent inhibitors interfere with protein binding, and whether inhibitors specifically bind to either protein. Disruption of this protein-protein interaction, through any mechanism, is the intended target activity.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to identify non-competititve inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its product, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with NADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. This assay is performed in the presence of 10x-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate, mannose-6-phosphate, to help to ensure the identification of non-competitive inhibitors. 1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.0 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml Diaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin. 3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6 ug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. PMI HTS protocol: 1) 2 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-48 of a Costar 1536-well black plate (cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser 2) 2 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) of a Costar 1536-well black plate (cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser 3) 40 nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1-4 using a HighRes biosolutions pintool and V&P Scientific pins 3) 40 nL of 2 mM compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed in columns 5-48 using a HighRes biosolutions pintool and V&P Scientific pins 4) 2 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 5) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 6) After 20 minutes the plates were read on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer), Ex544, Em590. 7) The screening was performed using a HighRes biosolution fully integrated HTS POD-based system 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). 1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate (cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix) 2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) 3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4) 2 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 5) 9 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 6) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 7) The plates were read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices), Ex544, Em590. 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase reticulocyte (hPK-R) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-R and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes.  Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen, cat# PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates. Following the Clk4 reaction, the remaining ATP levels were detected using Promega Kinase-Glo technology wherein the remaining ATP from the kinase reaction is detected using Ultra-Glo luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the ATP. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 300801-52-9) which has been described as an inhibitor of Clk 4[1]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 25 mM Tris pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner, solid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Using a Kalypsys pin tool equipped with a 1536-pin tool, 23 nL of compound solution was transferred to the assay plate. One uL/ well Clk4-buffer solution (25 nM Clk4, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentrations) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 3 uL/ well. After 4.5 hours of room temperature incubation, 3 uL Kinase-Glo reagent was added for a final assay volume of 6 uL/ well. Luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) after 5 min incubation using a 5 second exposure time and 2x binning.

Description:  Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492964). Compounds tested in this assay were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO-K1 cell line" (AID 493232). This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 66.2 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 66.2 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 66.2 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-85, and for inactive compounds 84-0.

Description:  The aim of this assay was to characterize selectivity of compounds originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Antagonists of GPR35" (AID 2058) against the unrelated vasopressin receptor. Compounds were either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized by the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics. This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and human vasopressin receptor type IIa.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay to identify potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2445). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds and agonist. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR potentiators will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. Following a pre-incubation of 6 minutes at room temperature, 15 nL of oxytocin (corresponding to an EC15 average response throughout the screen) in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration, EC100) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC100) and DMSO. The average percent activation and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the average hit cutoff calculated from assay plates treated with DMSO alone was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-65, for inactive 45-0.

Description:  A biochemical assay using the ADP-Hunter methodology, purified TAg, and ATP to identify compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of Tag. Assay Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. A biochemical fluorescence-intensity assay in 1536-well microplate format was developed to measure TAg ATPase activity in the presence of potentially inhibitory compounds. Z values are ~0.68, with > 3-fold S/B and a high (5%) DMSO tolerance. Primary Assay Conditions: The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Assay buffer was 100mM Tris-HCl, 20mM KCl, 6mM MgCl2, and 0.1mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4. Initially, 250nl of test compound (20uM final concentration) in 4% DMSO/assay buffer was added to the respective plate wells. Total reaction volume (without endpoint reagent) was 1.25ul. Total read volume (with endpoint reagent) was 5 ul. Enzyme and buffer volumeswere dispensed using a BioRAPTR FRD (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 500 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified TAg was diluted to a concentration of 0.0144 ug/ul in assay buffer. 750nl of TAg (14.4ng/ul, 10.8ng total) in assay buffer was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30m at ambient temperature. Following incubation, 250nl of 5mM ATP (A7699, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in assay buffer was added to the respective wells, and incubated for 120m at ambient temperature. Final DMSO concentration was 1.0%. Endpoint addition and read: After incubation, the ADPHunter-Plus Kit (DiscoverX, Freemont, CA) was used to determine the extent of TAg-induced ATP hydrolysis. 1.25ul of Reagent A, immediately followed by 2.5ul of Reagent B, was added to the wells, and allowed to incubate for a further 10m at ambient temperature. Addition of the kit stop solution had no effect on the assay and subsequently was not used. The plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 530/590nm respectively. Controls and Drug Addition: Controls included full reaction wells (TAg, DMSO blank, and ATP), background wells (Assay buffer, DMSO blank, and ATP), and control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate. Positive control drug (Mal112B) was diluted in 4% DMSO/assay media and added to each plate (250nl at 5x concentration), for a final concentration of 100uM. 2.5nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 20uM. DMSO concentration from the compounds amounted to 0.2%, bringing the total per well to 1%. DMSO in control wells was also supplemented, to maintain a concentration of 1% for all wells of each plate. Large T Antigen purification: TAg was purified essentially as described by Cantalupo, P., et. al.,1999. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with a TAg-encoding baculovirus. At 45 hpi, cells were harvested and lysed in LiCl and NP40-containing lysis buffer. The lysate was spun at 27000g and the high speed supernatant was loaded to a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column to which the resin had been covalently crosslinked to the monoclonal antibody PAb419. PAb419 has been previously described to recognize an N-terminal epitope of TAg. The column was washed, and then eluted at high pH. TAg containing fractions were dialyzed into 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM DTT, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. Data Analysis: 96 full reaction wells, 96 background wells, and 64 control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z score for the primary assay was 0.6. Results were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and calculated as: 100*((Median Enzyme Control-High Dose Ctrl Drug) - (Test well-High Dose Ctrl Drug))/(Median Enzyme Ctrl-High Dose Ctrl Drug). Dose response results for each concentration were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Compounds showing at least 50% inhibition were considered active and IC50 values were calculated using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and minimum locked at 100 and 0.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. The purpose of this assay confirm hits from "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the APJ receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2520. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect agonists that cause the activation the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen cat # PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates using Transcreener (trade mark), a competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assay [1]. For the present assay, we used the Orange TranscreenerTM ADP2 (BellBrooks Labs, Madison, Wis) detection system to monitor ADP production in the kinase reaction. In the assay, an ADP tracer exhibiting orange fluorescence is bound to an ADP antibody which can be displaced by the ADP product of the kinase reaction. This allows the ADP tracer to freely rotate leading to a decrease in the observed FP value. The amount of ADP produced can then be calculated using a calibration curve. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat # 300801-52-9) which is a Clk4 inhibitor [2]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 25 mM Tris pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was dispensed into 1,536-well assay plates (Greiner, solid black medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Using a Kalypsys pin tool equipped with a 1,536-pin tool, 23 nL of compound solution was transferred to the assay plate. Two uL/well Clk4-buffer solution (6.25 nM Clk4, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentration) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well. Then 4 uL/well of detection mixture (4 nM orange fluorescent tracer, 1 ug/mL ADP antibody, final concentration) was then added after an hour and the polarization signal was measured using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) after 30 min of room temperature incubation using the following filters and program settings: BODIPY TMR FP dual Enh mirror (barcode 682); BODIPY-TMR 531 (barcode 105) excitation; BODIPY-TMR FP P/S polarized 595 nm filters (barcodes 210 and 211, respectively); 100% light; 150 flashes; 1.35 G-factor; Detector gains were 685 for the 1st detector; 630 for the 2nd detector.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of SFLLRN-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with a selection of cherry picked compounds chosen based on activity in a retest at dose (AID 1889), a counterscreen for non-specific inhibitors to luciferase (AID 1891), not having known platelet activation inhibitory activity, and having potentially interesting chemical structure.  Compounds were tested at 100uM, 30uM, 1uM, and 0.3uM. Following compound addition, platelets were subsequently stimulated with 5 mM SFLLRN.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation.  Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a gate for the defined probe paths.  A moderate decrease in the amount of P-selectin expressed on the surface of platelets in a dose-dependent manner will identify compounds that inhibit pathways that regulate granule secretion or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) expressed on the surface of platelets.  Lack of substantial inhibition of surface expression of P-selectin is indicative of compounds that might selectively effect dense granule secretion. Additional secondary testing will further delineate the specificity of the probes. Primary Collaborators(and laboratory where this assay was performed): 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were tested at different concentrations of compound (100uM, 30uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for cherry-picks and 30uM, 10uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for powders). 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 uM thrombin-receptor-derived hexapeptide SFLLRN from 100 uM stock. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean fluorescence values were collected for each sample.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. EGFR and EGFR mutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

Description:  The relaxin hormone is involved in the variety of biological functions in normal tissues and diseases. The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary gland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin signaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through regulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis. Significantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung fibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human relaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive heart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic sclerosis. Upon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. cAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP increase is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists of the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit. This assay measures activation of a cell expressing V1B, another GPCR targeted by relaxin, to determine the selectivity of compounds for RXFP1. This is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP2 receptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were lysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell lysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to a decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer only) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin). The EC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation 1536-well assay protocol for the HEK293 V1B cAMP assay: (1) Add 3 ul HEK293 RXFP2 cell culture. 2000 cells/well in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (dispensed offline with MultiDrop Combi). (2) Incubate 16-24 hr at 37C, 5% CO2. (3) Add 1 ul 400uM Ro20174 in DPBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.005% Tween 20. (3) Add 23 nl compounds in DMSO solution. Final concentration was 0.5 - 58 uM. (4) Incubate 30 min at 37C, 5% CO2. (5) Add 1 ul cAMP-d2 in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (6) Add 1 ul anti-cAMP antibody-cryptate in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio).

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors Targeting the Menin-MLL Interaction in MLL Related Leukemias Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine  (Eu3+-AB) and  the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). FP Assay Reagents: 1. FP reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT. Before use, 0.05% BSA is added. 2. Menin protein, MLL-w.t. labeled with fluorescein, MLL-mutant peptide labeled with texas red. Stored in singe use aliquots at -80C. 3. MLL-w.t. unlabeled peptide as positive control: 10 uM final in FP buffer. FP Assay Procedure: 1. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, and MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM mixture in FP buffer. 2.

Description:  Recombinantly expresssed KvBeta was combined with 10uM test compound. Substrate turnover was measured using the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme-bound cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). When KvBeta catalyzed the reduction of the substrate, 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (4CY), NADPH was oxidized, and consequently, the fluorescence signal from NADPH decreased over time. Inhibitors prevented the decrease of the fluorescence signal in the presence of substrate. The Hamamatsu FDSS kinetic plate reader equipped with 340nm excitation and 460nm emission filters was used for data collection. 1. 15nL of test compounds were transferred to columns 3-22 of a Corning low volume, black wall, clear bottom, 384-well plate. 2. Compounds were diluted with 10uL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 3. Control wells contained 10uL of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the vehicle control. 4. 5uL of 1.5 OD280nm KvBeta was added to each well. 5. 5uL of 20mM 4CY or 5uL of PBS was added to each well to initiate the reaction. 6. The assay was incubated for 30minutes at room temperature with kinetic reads at 10 second intervals. 1. Flouresence intensity versus log of seconds was used to calculate the slope of the response curve between 70seconds and 1610seconds. Slope values used resulted from a linear fit of 30 iterations or a chi squared convergence equal to 0.0001. 2. Calculated slope values were treated as a Gaussian distribution. Compounds selected as 'Score' of 100 and 'Outcome' of Active had slope values that differed from the mean sample distribution at 99.7% confidence level.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses CRE-bla CHO cell line from Invitrogen. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the CRE-bla CHO cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen was used as positive control. The selected compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Human lipoxygenase 15hLO-1 is a member of the closely related lipoxygenase family of enzymes which catalyze the site-specific oxidation of arachidonic acid to various hormone precursor molecules and as such is a candidate for drug development in a variety of disease areas, such as cancer and inflammation. The enzyme activity of 15hLO-1 was determined by a direct measurement of product formation by monitoring the absorbance at 234 nm in a 2 mL cuvette. IC50 values of inhibitors were obtained by measuring the enzymatic rate at a variety of concentrations. This assay is includes some confirmation and follow-up compounds for related primary screening assay AID 887. The follow-up compounds focus on analogues of current lead 15hLO-1 inhibitor series. For control experiments, 2 mL of substrate buffer (7 uM arachidonic acid / 25 mM HEPES / 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5) was aliquoted in a cuvette with a magnetic stir bar. After equilibrium was ensured, an aliquot of inhibitor solvent was added (DMSO or MeOH), and equilibrium was once again assured. The reaction was started by adding enzyme to the cuvette and the reaction was followed until completed. The inhibition experiments were performed as above, except the actual inhibitory compound was added instead of vehicle. To achieve an IC50, typically 5 concentrations of the inhibitor were studied. If the inhibitor concentration was constant, then five different reaction volumes were used.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. Recent interest in cathepsin L has been generated by research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the SARS and Ebola viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin L inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that appear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion. A high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors was designed as an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Primary HTS results and dose-response confirmation have been reported previously (AIDs 460 and 825). Confirmed actives from dose-response testing were retested using cysteine in the assay buffer instead of DTT. This allows the exclusion of DTT-reactive artifacts that inactivate the enzyme in the presence of DTT but are inactive in the presence of cysteine. Human liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM cysteine. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1. Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2. Fill Corning low-volume 384-well black plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4. Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205. (Four parameter logistic fit; maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively; Hill slope limited to > -0.1.)

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of compounds to inhibit S1P3 activation. In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will decrease well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 1% BSA (0.8 micromolar final nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm.

Description:  Fluorescence dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). The purpose of this assay is to dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1509) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (AID 1523). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 5 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting #background# for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control)) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, High_Control is defined as wells containing S1P. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 48 and active compounds range of activity score is 51 to 100.

Description:  Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. Previously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) were screened to identity FPRL1 ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID 520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary intracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule FPRL1 antagonists. In the present analysis, 2 major chemotype families representing the most potent FPRL1 ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational screening techniques (2D substructure search) to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased for physical screening. The FPRL1 primary HTS assay was performed in 384 well format. Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration ranging from 3.9 to 8.3 microM (mean +- SD = 5.5 +- 0.8 microM) for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPRL1. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  In this counterscreen, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene, but lacking the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion that was present in the primary screening cell line. Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to off target effects. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well.  Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the pGL-3 LUC gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL compound, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.  The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay was developed to confirm hits from this primary screen, examining saturation transfer differences in NMR spectra upon incubation of the menin protein with compound. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Assay Reagents: 1. Menin protein 2. MLL w.t. 3. NMR buffer: 50mM phosphate, 50mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, pH = 7.5 NMR protocol: 1. Prepare 450 uL of menin (2.5 uM) in complex with 100uM compound in NMR buffer and run STD (Saturation Transfer Difference) on NMR Bruker 600 MHz 2. Prepare 450 uL of menin (2.5 uM) in complex with 100 uM compound and 25uM of MLL w.t. in NMR buffer and run STD (Saturation Transfer Difference) on NMR Bruker 600 MHz

Description:  Modification of proteins by SUMO is a dynamic and reversible process. SUMOylation/deSUMOylation cycle regulates SUMOs function. Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) are involved in both the maturation of SUMO precursors (endopeptidase cleavage) and deconjugation of the targets (isopeptidase cleavage). There are seven SENPs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) in humans, and several of these have been characterized as SUMO (or Nedd8) specific enzymes. SENP8 is not a SUMO protease, instead it functions on a small ubiquitin related protein Nedd8. The objective of this project is to generate small molecule inhibitors specific for SENP8 (the deNEDDylating enzyme). 1536-well chemiluminescent screening assay utilizes RLRGG-aminoluciferin peptide substrate and is based on SENP8-dependent deconjugation of the aminoluciferin, which serves as a substrate for the coupled luciferase.  This screening assay was developed and performed at the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN). 1) Z-RLRGG-aminoluciferin (Promega #X554X) 2) Luciferin Detection Reagent (LDR) Promega #V859B dissolved in 75mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 10mM MgSO4. 3) Full-length SENP8 - provided by Dr. Salvesen's laboratory. 4) Assay Buffer (75mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 4mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) 5) Corning 1536-well white microtiter plates (Cat #3725)  SENP8 primary HTS protocol: 1) Using Labcyte Echo555, dispense 10 nl of 2 mM compound into columns 5 through 48, while 10nl of 100% DMSO into columns 1 through 4. 2) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi nL, dispense 1 ul of 160 nM SENP8 in Assay Buffer into columns 3 through 48, while 1 ul of just Assay Buffer into columns 1 and 2. 3) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi nL, dispense 1 ul of 80 uM Z-RLRGG-aminoluciferine in LDR to all wells of the plate. 4) Centrifuge plates briefly 5) Incubate at room temperature for 60 min. 6) Read plates on a Perkin Elmer Envision 2104 plate reader using the ultra-sensitive luminescence mode.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect agonists that cause the activation the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in an uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the APJ receptor. This AT1 agonist assay utilizes the same luminescent b-Arrestin-based assay readout as the uHTS APJ primary assay. In both assays we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the KOR1 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLin. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. The purpose of this assay confirm hits from "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the APJ receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2520. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect agonists that can activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) in the CHO-K1 AGTR-1 b-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in HTS mode.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor. The purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y2 potentiation dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of experiments entitled, #Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID 1359), #Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2# (AID 1539), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, #Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1 (AID 1304), and #Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity# (PubChem AID 1703). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y2 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as a potentiator or agonist of NPY-2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control # MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-84, for inactives 63-0.

Description:  Recombinantly expressed KvBeta was combined with 30uM test compound and tested in duplicate. Substrate turnover was measured using the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme-bound cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). If KvBeta catalyzed the reduction of the test compound, NADPH was oxidized, and consequently, the fluorescence signal from NADPH decreased over time. 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (4CY) was used as the positive control, and the compound vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was used as the negative control. The Hamamatsu FDSS kinetic plate reader equipped with 340nm excitation and 460nm emission filters was used for data collection. 1. 15nL of test compounds were transferred to columns 3-22 of a Corning low volume, black wall, clear bottom, 384-well plate. 2. Compounds were diluted with 10uL of PBS. 3. 10uL of 15mM 4CY or 0.1% DMSO were added to columns 1, 2, 23 and 24 as the positive and negative controls, respectively. 4. 5uL of 1.5 OD280nm KvBeta was added to each well to initiate the enzymatic reaction. 5. The assay was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with kinetic reads at 10 second intervals. 1. Fluorescence intensity versus seconds was used to calculate the slope of the response curve between 20seconds and 320seconds. Slope values resulted from a linear fit of 30 iterations or from a chi squared convergence equal to 0.0001. 2. Calculated slope values were compared to the vehicle control. 3. Compounds given a 'Score' of '100' and 'Outcome' of 'Active' had slope values that were less than the 'Cutoff Value' which was calculated as the mean minus three times the standard deviations of the vehicle controls.

Description:  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein SMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2 which are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips exon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2 protein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1 locus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form, it is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy that either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has been proposed for the treatment of SMA. We have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional SMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that inclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus generating functional luciferase enzyme. As a counterscreen for nonspecific modulators of expression, we have run compounds through a similar assay that measures expression of an SMN1-luciferase chimera. This screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter with the major portion of the native SMN1 cDNA (exons 1 -7, intron 8 , exon 8 fused to luciferase) stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Compounds that increase luciferase signal presumably enhance expression of the functional SMN1 splice variant.

Description:  To identify new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors, we developed a cell-based IMPase assay in which the cytosolic IP1 is measured by a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. In this assay, an IP1 specific antibody is used to detect the labeled IP1 tracer. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (18.4 mM LiCl). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. IMPase 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Plate 4 ul/well (2000 cells) of cell suspension from frozen CHO-M1 Cells in white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates that are cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of carbachol (50 uM in stimulation buffer containing10mM HEPES, 1mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 4.2 mM KCl, 146 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 50mM LiCl, pH 7.4. (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 30 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well of d2-conjugated IP1 (d2-IP1) and 1 ul/well of Eu+ cryptate conjugated anti-IP1 antibody (Eu+-Ab) prepared in the cell lysis buffer, both from the IP-One kit (Cisbio, MA). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells, respectively.  The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ.  The gene products are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica.  During the past year Dr. Harris' group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi.  They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as PhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing verses inducing conditions for each of the promoters.  This allowed for the development of a primary screening and counterscreening assays for PhoP-specific inhibitors which may lead to the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection. The inhibition eukaryotic cell culture growth was established using THP1 cells (ATCC Cat. # TIB-202), a Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. This counter-screening assay for eukaryotic culture growth inhibition was performed after the main confirmatory (dose-response) assay.  This counterscreen assay was cell-based in 384-well plate format and tested the cytotoxicity of compounds only, without the addition of bacteria. This assay was conducted with all 2237 screened in the confirmation and counterscreens.  Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown and incubated with compounds in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS, for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal. Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This image-based fluorescent beta-arrestin assay was performed to confirm hits originally identified in the uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the KOR receptor. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Dynorphin (American Peptide #24-4-50, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 10uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 3.1% DMSO in water 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Dose Response Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 500nM to 32uM (seven doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Dynorphin final concentration was 1uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.3%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate.

Description:  The E3 ligases are involved in regulating other proteins by covalent ligation to the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin. This post-translational modification can result in altered conformation, altered activity, or degradation of the substrate protein. Thus, E3 ligases are effectors of a major means of post-translational modification of proteins in many species, including mammals. The dipeptide boronic acid bortezomib is a potent proteasome inhibitor, has selective anticancer activity in tumor cells and in mice and was recently approved for clinical use in multiple myeloma. MDM2 E3 ligase is involved in numerous types of human cancer. Selective E3 ligase inhibitors would be preferable as they would be more selective and less toxic. Inhibitors of the MDM2-UBCH5 interaction should disrupt the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 and therefore its oncogenic activity. Such inhibitors could be developed into novel therapeutic agents for sarcomas involving MDM2 overexpression or amplification, irrespective of their p53 status. Patients with sarcomas are likely to benefit from this approach because of their high frequency of MDM2 protein overexpression and MDM2 gene amplification. Cellular autoubiquitination assay: an MDM2-GFP fusion protein autoubiquitinates and autodegrades in vivo. This approach was adapted to luciferase, because luciferase is easier to detect in high-throughput assays. A cellular assay for autoubiquitination in 384-well format was designed. An MDM2 E3-luciferase fusion protein was stably transfected into mammalian cells. The fusion protein autoubiquitinates, targeting itself for degradation. Luminescence is used to monitor protein abundance. A negative control of inactive RING domains fused to luciferase, known to have no ubiquitination activity, has been developed as a counterscreen. We have used a cell-based MDM2 autoubiquitination screen to identify small molecules that inhibit MDM2 E3 ligase activity. The cell based assay uses full-length MDM2 fused to luciferase. This construct autoubiquitinates itself and autodegrades. The screen will identify compounds that prevent this autodegradation and stabilize the MDM2-luciferase construct by blocking MDM2 E3 ligase activity. Thus inhibitors will show an enhanced luminescence signal. We have earlier screened 218,724 compounds of the MLSCN library (AID 1230) and identified 220 actives. Of the 200 compounds tested, 40 showed a good dose-response and were reported as hits against E3 ligase (AID 1394). These 40 compounds were retested for dose-response in triplicate, which is reported here. Cells (wild-type or mutant) were plated and allowed to settle at 37C overnight. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of compound (final DMSO conc:0.25%) at 37C for 2 hrs. SteadyLite luciferase reagent was added, plates incubated for 30 mins and then read on Envision reader. Dose-response protocol 1.Fill 384 well plate with 24 uL of cells (wild-type or mutant) in DMEM (7500 cells per well) using Wellmate (all columns except 1 and 23) 2.Add 24 uL DMEM to columns 1 and 23 using Wellmate 3. Seal plates with Breathe-easy membranes and incubate at 37C overnight 4.Dilute 1 ul of compound from dose-response plate with 79 ul DMEM to get a diluted dose-response plate (top concentration 125 uM) 5.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (PubChem AID 1539) act as agonists of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 9 and active compounds range of activity score is 9 to 100.

Description:  A modified strain of Vibrio harveyi with constitutive on quorum sensing system will be exposed to small molecules identified from the HTS screen used to identify LuxS inhibitors and LuxPQ antagonists. Growth of the organism post exposure will be followed using optical density and disruption of down stream quorum sensing elements will be observed  based on decreased luminescent signal. Expected Outcome: Identification of AI-2 quorum sensing system inhibitors with modes of action which either antagonize the LuxPQ receptor or inhibit LuxS synthase.  Such inhibitors should not perturb growth (observed by optical density) nor the constitutive on quorum sensing (observed by luminescence).

Description:  Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to identify compounds that inhibit S1P2 activity. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and the cells express low BLA levels. Treatment of the cells with an S1P agonist stimulates the S1P2 receptor and activates BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by S1P, and as a result decreases transcription of the BLA gene. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 61 available of 64 compounds that had greater than 50 percent inhibition and passed hit selection criteria from a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)" (PubChem AID = 736). Dose response curves were subsequently determined for a set of 22 purchased compounds structurally similar to the hit compound (SID 14730083, SID 46371185) identified in a set of experiments entitled "Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor" (PubChem AID = 851, this experiment) and "Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of CRE-BLA" (PubChem AID =856).   A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with both the S1P2 receptor and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct was used. Cells were cultured 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL geneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum.  Next, 10 ul(100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension was dispensed into each well of the assay plates and incubate in the plates for 20 hrs at 37 degrees C, 5 percent CO2 and 95 percent RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound in DMSO, DMSO (negative control wells) or JTE-013 (final nominal concentration 3 uM, positive control wells) to the appropriate wells.  Immediately after this dispense, 1 ul of S1P in 2 percent BSA (final concentration of 750 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80 percent activity) was dispensed into negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol including 15 mM probenecid) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio (I460nm/I590nm) where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers as follows: Percent Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/ (median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound and 750nM S1P Positive control is defined as wells containing 3 uM JTE-013 alone (100 percent inhibition) Negative control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 750 nM S1P (0 percent inhibition) For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in > 50 percent inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated from pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and is based on the observed pIC50 range.  Specifically, the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent inhibition is observed. This calculation resulted in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Retinoic acid induced NF-kB luciferase in HEK293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells is developed and performed to test whether the compound SID 17450324 inhibits RIG1 induced NF-kB pathway.  SID 17450324 was identified in earlier assays, 1266, 1269, 1270, 1287 and 1368 as a possible candidate to selectively inhibit NF-kB activation. RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), a member of the RNA helicases, is activated by cytoplasmic dsRNA produced during the viral replication. The protein is characterized by a N-terminal region with two caspase recruitment domains (CARD) and a C-terminal region harboring potential ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. RIG-1 recruits the CARD adaptor inducing IFN-beta (Cardif) in a CARD-CARD-dependent manner resulting in NF-kB activation (Takashi 2006). We used retinoic acid to activate RIG-1 dependent NF-kB activation. Reference Takashi Fujita. VIROLOGY: Sensing Viral RNA Amid Your Own. Science 2006(314)5801, 935 - 936 Materials, 1.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5mM stock diluted to 50uM in water. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Naloxone was added to column 1 and 24.  Naloxone final concentration was 1uM.   d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Damgo was added to the entire plate, except column 23. Damgo final concentration was 5uM. Plates were then incubated for another 45 minutes. 7) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  8) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 9) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 10) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 11) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.  Analysis settings: Nuclei Detection Threshold Adjustment: 1.5 Nuclear Individual Threshold Adjustment:  0.45 Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7 Minimum Nuclear Area:    70 Minimum Nuclear Distance:    7 Minimum Nuclear Contrast:    0.1 Cytoplasm Detection Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:   0.2 Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.1 Spot Detection Spot Minimum Distance    3 Spot Peak Radius     0 Spot Reference Radius    3 Spot Minimum Contrast    0.3 Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   1 3) Metrics calculated from Nuclei Images: Cell Count (NumberofCellsAnalyzed), Nuclei Area (AreaoftheNucleus), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei (TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus), Average Intensity of the Nuclei (AverageIntensityoftheNucleus) GFP Images: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm (TotalCytoplasmIntensity), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots (TotalSpotIntensity), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities (RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity), Number of Spots per Cell (AverageSpotsPerCell), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation (PercentagePositiveCells) 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. EC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to confirm PPARgamma/SRC3 activity of compounds identified as active in at least two of the following experiments: "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 731), "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 631), and "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 1032). This assay tests the ability of compounds to modulate the interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate. Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration) or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells. Immediately after addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following mathematical expressions: t15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. Data were evaluated using % Activation. Any compound that exhibited an average % Activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonist dose response from powder samples. Compounds with S1P4 antagonist IC50 less than 1 micromolar in Pubchem AID 1692 were selected based on presence of a tractable chemical structure and absence of known activities towards other targets. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22 micromolar final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-99, for inactive 99-0.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect antagonists that inhibit the activation of the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

Description:  Counterscreen for agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GalR2): a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for activators of beta-lactamase activity Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.25 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of 1536-well plates (1000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours. After this incubation, 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (5 uM final nominal concentration; 0.5% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of PBS (control wells) or thapsigargin in PBS (positive control wells; 500 nM final concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1 ul per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at 25 degrees C, well fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only.  To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 1 ul of PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 1 ul of 2.5 uM thapsigargin in PBS. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  The formylpeptide receptor (FPR) family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) contributes to the localization and activation of tissue-damaging leukocytes at sites of chronic inflammation.  FPR ligands trigger a variety of biologic activities in myeloid cells, including chemokinesis, chemotaxis, cytokine production and superoxide generation.  It has been proposed that a primary FPR function is to promote trafficking of phagocytic myeloid cells to sites of infection and tissue damage where they exert anti-bacterial effector functions and clear cell debris.  FPR have also recently been identified in hepatocytes, immature dendritic cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and the tunica media of coronary arteries.  Known FPR ligands include formylated peptides, annexin I (lipocortin I) and selected HIV-1 envelope proteins.  FPR have been proposed as prospective targets for therapeutic intervention against malignant gliomas. A flow cytometry based high throughput screening (HTS) campaign was undertaken to identify novel small molecule FPR ligands. A set of compounds was identified for the physical screening on the basis of preliminary virtual screening of ~480,000 drug-like small molecules from Chemical Diversity Laboratories, Inc (San Diego, CA). The virtual screen employed a FPR homology model based on the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure and a pharmacophore based on known FPR ligands. The FPR assay measured the ability of test compounds to compete with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand, fMLFK-FITC, for binding to cell membrane FPR. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1st, test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2nd, U937 cells expressing transfected human FPR (107/mL, 5 microL/well); 3rd, (after 30 min, 4C incubation) fMLFK-FITC (5 microL/well, Kd = 3 nM).  After an additional 45 min, 4C incubation, plates are immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range is defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled fMLFF (4Pep) receptor blocking peptide or buffer.   Test compounds are assessed for the ability to inhibit peptide binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent fMLFK-FITC from FPR.  Compounds inhibiting 65% or more are considered active, subject to further evaluation.  The assay is homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide are added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform is used to sequentially sample cells from wells (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation. The resulting time-resolved data files are analyzed with IDLQuery software.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse. The cannabinoid receptors (type 1 and 2) are members of the G-protein coupled receptor family and have been found to be involved in alterations in mood and cognition, as experienced by marijuana users. The specific aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55" (AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the cannabinoid receptor type 1. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the CB1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: WIN55212 (Sigma W102 25mg) - 5mM stock in DMSO).  5) Negative Control Working Solution: AM251 (Sigma A6226-10mg) 5mM stock in DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powders, working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The #dose response protocol# was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. AM251 was added to column 1 and 24. AM251 (positive control) final concentration was 1uM.  c. DMSO was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) After 30 minutes, WIN55212 was added to the entire plate except column 23.  Final WIN55212 concentration was 1uM.  Plates were incubated for another 60 minutes. 7) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  8) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 9) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 10) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 11) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml.

Description:  Fluorescence polarization-based counterscreen for RBBP9 inhibitors: primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the oxidoreductase glutathione S-transferase omega 1(GSTO1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of the oxidoreductase glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1), which has a catalytic cysteine residue and is sensitive to thiol alkylating agents such as N-ethylmaleimide. This assay also serves as a counterscreen to identify thiol-reactive compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)" (AID 1515). In this assay, recombinant GSTO1 protein is incubated with test compounds and a Rh-conjugated sulfonate ester (SE) activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as GSTO1 inhibitors will prevent GSTO1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1.25 micromolar of GSTO1-1 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM PS-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Prior to reading, plates were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular) on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) Where: Low_Control is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no GSTO1-1 enzyme. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-17, for inactive 17-0. List of Reagents: Recombinant GSTO1-1 (supplied by Assay Provider) PS-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider) Tris HCl (Sigma, part T3038) NaCl (Sigma, part S6546) Pluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176) DTT (Sigma, part D9779)

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalingTheir diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). Furthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for the study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. This cytotoxicity counterscreen was performed as part of a probe development effort to identify inhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester scaffold.

Assay Overview: Please see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this probe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of inhibitor compounds belonging to the oxime ester scaffold. In this assay, HEK cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. Protocol Summary: This assay was started by dispensing 5 x 10E3 HEK 293T cells/well into a 96-well plate. Compound (0.001-100 mM) or DMSO was added to each well, and after 48h cell viability was determined by the CellTitre assay (Promega).

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (PubChem AID 1446), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F" (AID 1521), were nonselective due to inhibition of parental Ba/F3 cell line cytotoxicity. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of assays entitled, "Luminescent dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Janus kinase 2 mutant JAK2V617F" (PubChem AID 1691). In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit cell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 uM. The murine Ba/F3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1ng/mL IL-3, and 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red free RPMI supplemented as above except with 2ng/mL IL-3. The assay was started by dispensing 25 ul of cell suspension to each well. Next, 100 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (3 uM final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, 5 microliters of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the Envision reader (PerkinElmer).

Description:  Fluorescence-based dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay for agonists of NPY-Y1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Therefore, the identification and characterization of small molecule modulators of NPY signaling and high affinity selective ligands for NPY receptors may prove useful for understanding NPY-associated human disease. The purpose of this assay is to determine Y1 agonist dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1697), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID 1359), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-75, for inactive 67-0.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues, which releases alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in humans. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in the lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg: cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has been reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. 1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identification of novel small molecule inhibitors or activators with structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop new pharmacological chaperones. Previous assays of alpha-Glucosidase have utilized a non-natural fluorescent substrate to probe enzyme activity. The present assay measures enzyme activity on glycogen using a coupled-assay system to glucose oxidase. This is an enzyme assay using glycogen from bovine liver (Sigma catalog #: G0885) as the substrate and recombinant human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon hydrolysis of the substrate, the glucose product can be detected using the Amplex Red Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen catalog #: A22189). The product of this reaction can be read with a fluorescence plate reader with an excitation at 573 nm and an emission at 610 nm. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). The AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer for enzyme reaction: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.01% Tween-20 (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) Assay buffer for Amplex Red reaction: Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 1536-well assay protocol for the alpha-glucosidase assay: (1) Add 2 ul/well alpha-glucosidase enzyme solution (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of glycogen substrate solution (30 ug) (4) Incubate at 37 C for 40 min (5) Add 2 ul tris-HCl buffer with Amplex Red reagents (6) Incubate 45 min at room temperature. (7) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=573 nm and Em=610nm.

Description:  Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify potentiators of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as potentiators of the human OTR. In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds and agonist. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR potentiators will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. Following a pre-incubation of 6 minutes at room temperature, 15 nL of oxytocin (corresponding to an EC15 average response throughout the screen) in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration, EC100) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC100) and DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-23, for inactive 61-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for agonists of NPY-Y2. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor. The purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y2 agonist dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1710), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (PubChem AID 1703). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-78, for inactive compounds 77-0.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871) were nonselective due to activation of STAT1. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932). In this assay activation of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1-luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An activator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing luminescence. As designed, test compounds that increase STAT1 activity are considered non-selective activators. The activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, or DMSO (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells. Next, 28 nL of nifuroxazide (100 uM final concentration in DMSO) were added to a subset of control wells, to monitor that the assay was functioning properly. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to sample and High Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase  muscle 2 (hPK-M2)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-M2 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-M2 and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes.  Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  The activity of PMK was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of absorbance (OD340) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for PMK inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited PMK and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of PMK. Phosphomevalonate Kinase Protocol for 384-well HTS 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 3 mM MgCl2 2 mM ATP 0.04 mM Phosphomevalonate 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.4 mM NADH 3 units/ml rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 3 units/ml rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase 30 nM Phosphomevalonate Kinase (PMK) 4% DMSO Fifteen uL substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 uL volumes using the FX.  The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL of PMK using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the PMK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing PMK with hexokinase.

Description:  A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 activation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators would increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely proportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1 agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar SEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. In addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also determined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the parental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications. For the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay except test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the parental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the #potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM forskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For the agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the parental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and SEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar (forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871 was also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e. its EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma part#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting #background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 100 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Damgo final concentration was 1 uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate.

Description:  Human neutrophil cathepsin G was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219373). Substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1465.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 M sodium chloride. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin G (4.2 ug/mL) was incubated with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 3 hr at room temperature. Activity of single compounds identified from mixture HTS were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (8.4 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 3 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  The recombinant hexaHis-tagged 14-3-3gamma were expressed and purified as previously described (Fu et al, PNAS, 1993). The peptide sequence containing phosphorylated S259 of Raf-1 was synthesized and labeled with 5/6 carboxytetramethylrhodamine. HEPES buffer (10mM, pH 7.4), NaCl (150mM), Tween-20 (0.05%), and DTT (0.5 mM) was used through the screening. The 14-3-3 FP assay was carried out in black 384-well uplates in a total volume of 50uL in each well. 49uL of assay reaction buffer (1uM of His-14-3-3gamma and 2nM of TMR-pS259-Raf peptide in HEPES buffer) were dispensed to 384-well black plate. For each assay plate, column 1, 2 and 23, 24 contain controls: TMRpS259-Raf peptide only (blank) and TMR-pS259-Raf peptide with His-14-3-3gamma (negative control); R18 peptide was added to wells with TMR-pS259-Raf peptide and His-14-3-3gamma and serve as positive control. Each compound was tested in triplicate at the noted concentrations. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr and the fluorescence polarization value in millipolarization (mP) units was measured with an Analyst HT reader. An excitation filter at 545nm and an emission filter at 610 to 675nm were used with a dichroic mirror of 565 nm. Assay data was analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of control was calculated by dividing mP (subtracting blank) value from compound wells by the average mP (subtracting blank) from negative controls (His-14-3-3gamma and peptide) in each plate. For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% level of Y-intercept.  When the highest concentration tested (50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as greater than 50 micromolar.  Similarly, when the lowest concentration tested (1.5625 micromolar) resulted in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 is reported as less than 1.5625 micromolar. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 30 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with an IC50 equal or less than 30 micromolar are considered active.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. Recent interest in cathepsin L has been generated by research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the SARS and Ebola viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin L inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that appear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion. The high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors reported here consisted of an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Human liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 10 uM compound as described below. 1. Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 2. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 3. Add 200 nL of compound (0.5 mM in DMSO) using Evolution pintool 4. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 5. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 6. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 7. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader

Description:  Many genetic and environmental diseases result from defective protein folding within the secretory pathway so that aberrantly folded proteins are recognized by the cellular surveillance system and retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Under conditions of malfolded protein accumulation, the cell activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to clear the malfolded proteins, and if unsuccessful, initiates a cell death response. Preliminary studies have shown that CHOP is a crucial factor in the apoptotic arm of the UPR; XBP1 activates genes encoding ER protein chaperones and thereby mediates the adaptive UPR response to increase clearance of malfolded proteins. Inhibition of CHOP is hypothesized to enhance survival by preventing UPR programmed cell death. There are currently no known small molecule CHOP inhibitors either for laboratory or clinical use. To identify small molecule inhibitors of the UPR pathway, mediated by CHOP, a cell-based luciferase reporter assay using stably transfected CHO-K1 cells with luciferase driven by the CHOP promoter has been developed. The assay have been optimized and validated in 384-well format and used to screen for inhibitors of tunicamycin-induced CHOP in HTS. These identified compounds will have potential therapeutic application to diverse disease states ranging from diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, to hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. 1. Cell line:  CHO-CHOP cells with a  luciferase reporter driven by the CHOP promoter  (provided by assay PI) 2. Cell growth media (Ham's F12 + Glutamax, 10% FBS, 1X non-essential amino acids, and penicillin:streptomycin) (Invitrogen) 3. Tunicamycin (Calbiochem) 4. SteadyGlo reagent (Promega) Protocol: 1. 40 uL of medium containing CHO-CHOP cells (3000-4000) were dispensed to 384 well white opaque plates (Corning #3570) using a Multidrop combi (Thermo-Fisher Scientific).  Plates were then incubated for 24 hrs at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2. 2. 0.5 uL of library compounds (1 mM in DMSO) was added to wells using Sciclone (Caliper LifeSciences). The final concentration of compound is 10 uM. 3. 10 uL of fresh medium containing tunicamycin (Tm) (2.0 ug/ml, final concentration,) was then added and the plates were incubated for 15-18 hrs. 4. Medium was aspirated with an Elx405 plate washer (BioTek), leaving 10 uL of medium in the well. 10 uL of Steady-Glo was added to each well using a multildrop combi. 5. Luminescence signal was measured on an Envision Multilable plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data Analysis: 1. Assay results are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate: % of inhibition = 100 - (Luminescence compound - Luminescence blank) / (Luminescence control - Luminescence blank) * 100 Where Luminescence compound is the luminescence signal from a well with a test compound and Tm, Luminescence blank is an average luminescence signal from wells without Tm. Luminescence control is an average of luminescence signals from wells containing Tm with vehicle only. 3. Compounds that cause > 70% inhibition are defined as positives

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 50 units/well catalase (from bovine liver, Sigma cat#100), 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9) The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of RBBP9. In this assay, a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization in the well. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.94 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 ul of Assay Buffer (0.1% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 2.5 uM of RBBP9 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.794% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 ul of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 45 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (Test_Compound_mP -median_Positive_Control_mP) / (median_Negative_Control_mP - median_Positive_Control_mP)*100 Where: Negative_Control is defined as wells containing RBBP9 and DMSO, Test_Compound is defined as wells containing RBBP9 in the presence of test compound, Positive_Control is defined as wells containing no RBBP9 protein. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 6 and active compounds range of activity score is 6 to 100. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. List of Reagents: Recombinant RBBP9 (supplied by Assay Provider) FP-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider) Tris HCl (Sigma, part T3038) NaCl (Sigma, part S6546) Pluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in the uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the KOR receptor. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Damgo final concentration was 1uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml.

Description:  In vitro luciferase assay using purified luciferase was developed and performed to exclude the false positive hits which inhibit luciferase activity directly. The NIH library consisted of 61,609 compounds at the time of the primary screen by the Scripps Center. From this screen, 56 hits showed significant inhibition at 3 uM. Of them, 17 compounds were obtained from DPI and studied further for their activity in different assays.  The Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics screened the ChemBridge 50K DiverSet library, the SIGMA LOPAC library, and the Microsource libraries and identified 10 additional compounds.  A total of 27 compounds were tested in this assay. Materials: 1. ATPlite kit, which contains purified luciferase enzyme and assay buffer (Perkin-Elmer) 2. ATP (Sigma) 3. Luminometor (LJL biosystem) Protocol: 1. 45 uL ATPlite solution was added into white 96-well plates 2. Compounds were diluted in water and 5 uL was added into each well to reach desired final concentrations 3. 2 h later, 50 uL ATP solution (160nM) was added into each well and luminescence was read using a luminometer (final ATP concentration is 80 nM). 4. The luminescence of untreated wells (as control) was set to 100% and the data of each compound were processed and presented as the percentage of control.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-012) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Chronic pain (neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, cancer pain) is a major health problem. Opiate-based drugs, such as morphine and morphine derivatives, are the primary standard of care for the treatment of chronic pain.  Unfortunately, patients develop tolerance to opiates due to desensitization of the opiate receptor.  Thus, alternative anti-nociceptive ("pain killing") pathways need to be explored for treatment of chronic pain. The N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV2.2s) in dorsal root ganglia neurons is a well validated target for chronic pain (1, 2). We previously demonstrated the interaction between CaV2.2 and the first PDZ domain of molecular adaptor protein Mint1 (3). In additional experiments we demonstrated that carboxyl-terminal association of CaV2.2 protein with the Mint1-PDZ domain plays an important role in synaptic targeting and function of N-type Ca2+ channels (4). The following describes a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF) HTS assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of association between Mint1-PDZ domains and N-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl-terminal peptide (NC peptide). Compounds that disrupt the interaction would result in decrease of TR-FRET ratio and are detected in the assay. Small molecules identified in the screening would serve as useful probes for studies of synaptic function of N-type Ca2+ channels, its validation as a therapeutic target and/or as starting point for development of anti-nociceptive therapeutic agents with novel mechanism of action. Assay materials: 1) Biotin, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein (GST-M15) and biotinylated (biotin-) N-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl-terminal peptide (biotin-NC peptide) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of CaV2.2 protein were supplied by assay provider. 2) Anti-GST monoclonal antibody labeled with europium cryptate (EuK-anti-GST-mAb (CisBio cat# 61GSTKLB) and streptavidin-XL665 (CisBio cat# 610SAXLB ). 3) Potassium Fluoride (KF)  (Aqua Solutions cat# P3901) 4) Tween-20 (Sigma cat# 9416) 5) Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma cat# A7888) Working solutions: 1. Assay buffer: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100mM NaCl,0.1% BSA, 0.005% Tween-20 2. Mint1-PDZ working solution (1.75X final concentration) contains 3.5 nM GST-MINT-PDZ and 0.63 nM EuK-anti-GST-mAb 3. Biotin-NC peptide-XL665 solution (3.5X final concentration) contained 167 nM biotin-NC peptide and 46.6 nM streptavidin XL665. 4. Biotin solution (3.5X final concentration): 167 nM Biotin 3.5X final concentration) and 46.6 nM streptavidin XL665. 5. TR-FRET enhancing solution (7X final concentration): 3.2 M KF. Primary Screen and Single-concentration confirmation 1) Dispense 4 uL Mint1-PDZ working solution to entire 1536-well white plate (Corning# 3725) 2) Using a HighRes biosolution pintool equipped with V&P Scientific pins add 70 nL of DMSO (col 1-4) or 2-mM compound solutions in DMSO (col 5-48) 3) Incubate for 30 mins 4) Dispense 2 uL Biotin working solution to columns 1 & 2 5) Dispense 2 uL of Biotin-NC peptide working solutions to columns 3-48 6) Incubate for 30 mins 7) Dispense 1 uL 3.2 M KF to entire plate 8) Spin down plates at 1000 rpm for 1 min in an Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge. 9) Read plate on a BMG Labtech PheraStar in a Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence mode (Ex: 337 nm; Em: 620/665 nm) within 10 min

Description:  Doxorubincin induced NF-kB luciferase in HEK 293-NF-kB-Luc stable cells is developed and performed to test whether the compound SID 17450324 inhibits DNA damage induced NF-kB pathway.  SID 17450324 was identified in earlier assays, 1266, 1269, 1270, 1287 and 1368 as a possible candidate to selectively inhibit NF-kB activation. Different from antigen receptor induced NF-kB pathway, DNA damage induced NF-kB activation required PIDD (p53-induced protein with death domain) which forms a complex with the kinase RIP1 and a component of the NF-kB-activating kinase complex, NEMO, in response genotoxic stress. We used doxorubincin to induce DNA damage and then activate NF-kB. Reference Janssens, A. Tinel, S. Lippens, J. Tschopp. PIDD Mediates NF-kB Activation in Response to DNA Damage.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers).  Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity.  Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027).  Following overnight growth, 100 nL of 3.75 mM compound was added to the cell solutions (7.5 uM final [compound]).  The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in dose (12-point, 2-fold dilution, from 20 uM final [compound]) and was incorporated at the beginning and end of each days run.  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added.  The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured.  Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2.  Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge.  The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media.  Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions).  Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions).  Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carosel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carosel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by mutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this pathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single gene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer the LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable overlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within each type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2 (Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5 yrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. CDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of Man-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is not effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI reaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia) will benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic flux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a non-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting; however, identification of chemical probes with diverse modes of action (MOA) would be advantageous for further characterization of PMI and PMM variants.  The purpose of this assay is to identify inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its product, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with NADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. This assay is performed in the presence of near-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate, mannose-6-phosphate, to ensure the identification of inhibitors with diverse MOAs. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "HTS identification of compounds inhibiting phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) via a fluorescence intensity assay" (AID 1209) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. PMI assay materials: 1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml Diaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin. 3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6 ug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. PMI Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate (cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix) 2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) 3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4) 2 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 5) 9 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 6) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 7) The plates were read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices), Ex544, Em590. 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).

Description:  Human plasma factor XIIa alpha was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Cat # HFXIIa 1212a). Substrate Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1595.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% Tween 20. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Factor XIIa alpha (3.5 ug/mL) was incubated with Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 2 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 50 uM compound mixture (5 uM each of 10 compounds). IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (7.0 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  The transcriptional cell-based assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor RORA (encoded by the pFA-hRORA plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hRORA and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated RORA nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential inhibitors of the RORA nuclear receptor. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M1 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M1-expressing CHO cells as described [1]. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 micrograms of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1 micromolar atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 microliters. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1micrometer pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30 micromolar, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less. 1. Shirey JK, Xiang Z, Orton D, Brady AE, Johnson KA, Williams R, Ayala JE,Rodriguez AL, Wess J, Weaver D, Niswender CM, Conn PJ., "An allosteric potentiator of M4 mAChR modulates hippocampal synaptic transmission." Nat Chem Biol. 2008 Jan;4(1):42-50. PMID: 18059262 Data Fitting: Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Log10 values of each compound concentration are reported. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a  full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion. Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media pre-warmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then re-lidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  As with the primary screen, the dose-response assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the pFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear receptors. Compounds that increase the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the increase of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential activators of the SF-1 nuclear receptor. This assay was conducted in triplicate in 1536-well format. Six million CHO-K1 cells were seeded in T-175 flasks (Corning part #431080) containing 20 milliliters of F12 media (Invitrogen part #31765-092) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Gemini part #900-108) and 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin mix (Invitrogen part #15640-055). Flasks were then incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity.

Description:  Disease: Spinal Muscular Atrophy Rationale: Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a pediatric genetic disease that results from homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Patients have a second gene, SMN2, that is closely related in sequence to SMN1 and encodes the same SMN protein. However, the SMN2 gene is alternatively spliced, producing 30% of the full length mRNA and 70% of am mRNA species that excludes exon 7. Compounds that increase the frequency with which exon 7 is included into the SMN2 mRNA cause a concomitant increase in the level of SMN protein and are of therapeutic value to SMA patients. We developed a 384-well-based high-throughput screen for compounds that correct this splicing defect in the SMN2 gene without affecting splicing of the SMN1 gene. Signal Type: bigger is better Cell Lines: C33A human cervical carcinoma cells (ATCC# HTB-31) were stably transfected with an SMN fragment/luciferase reporter gene construct that incorporates exons 6-8 of SMN1 or SMN2. These cell lines are referred to here as SMN1 and SMN2 cells, respectively. Growth Medium: The growth medium for the SMN1 and SMN2 cells lines was made from Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma F 2442), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ ml streptomycin sulfate and 400mg/L G418 (Geneticin from Gibco, cat. no.11811-031). Assay Medium: The cell culture medium used for the luciferase assay (assay medium) was identical to the growth medium without the G418 selection agent. Assay Reagent: Luciferase assay reagentA single reagent, optimized for signal/cost, was used to lyse the cells and to initiate the luciferase reaction. The assay reagent consists of: 25mM glycylglycine, 15mM magnesium sulfate, 4mM EGTA, adjusted to a pH of 7.85, to which was added 10 M D-luciferin (Sigma L 9504), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals 100034), 2 mM adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP, Sigma A7699), 50 M Coenzyme A, sodium salt (Sigma C 3144) and 1.5% Triton X-100. Screen: incubation of cells with test compoundsFor the luciferase assay, cells were removed from T-175 culture flasks with 3 mL trypsin, quenched with 7 ml assay medium. The cells (~35-40M cells/flask) were spun down and re-suspended in assay medium to a concentration of ~200,000 cells/ml. The cells were immediately seeded with a Zymark SciClone ALH in 384-well assay plates (Nalge Nunc white plates, #164610) 57 L/well for a cell density of 11,000 cells/well. Compounds from the NINDS library were added to reach a final concentration of 10 M (diluted with assay medium by 1000x from the 10 mM stock solution in DMSO). The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37 degrees C for ~48 hours. A Zymark Sciclone ALH was used for both cell seeding and compound addition. After incubation, the assay plates were cooled to room temperature for ~10-60 minutes. The medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells, followed by 6 rinse/aspirate cycles with a PBS solution. 53 L of the luciferase assay reagent was added and the plate was immediately transferred to a luminescence plate reader. The plate was shaken for 30 seconds prior to reading. The plate processing steps were performed on an integrated Packard Minitrak/Sidetrak. Data Analysis: The dark count background was first subtracted from all luminescence readings. The signal from each compound-treated well was divided the average of 48 control wells on the same 384-well plate. Each compound library plate was tested in triplicate with each of the two cell lines and the entire assay was repeated on two separate occasions, yielding six readings for each compound for each cell line. The highest and lowest of the six normalized readings were dropped and the remaining four readings averaged. These average values of compound-treated luminescence versus control luminescence are denoted Xnorm(y) where X indicates the cell line, SMN1 or SMN2, and y is the compound. The difference of SMN2norm (y)-SMN1norm (y) measures the selective change in SMN2 luciferase expression versus change in SMN1 luciferase production upon treatment with compound y. The is the final score that is output. Dilution Series: 48 compounds were selected for retesting in a two-fold, 20-point dilution series with a maximum concentration of 10 M. These dilutions were created with a Zymark Sciclone ALH Z-8. Once created, the assay was performed as described in the screening section. Concentrations required to achieve 50% of the maximally achievable effect for each compound (EC50) were calculated using Xlfit (IDBS).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (column 3) and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme in column 2). To monitor activation, the first column contained a titration of the activator, NCGC00031955-03 (16-point 1:2 dilutions in duplicate starting at 57 uM) and the first 16 rows of column 4 contained 57 uM of NCGC00031955-03.

Description:  Validation assay for identification of compounds that inhibit the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4). To validate the hit compounds that inhibit the RGS4 protein from the primary screen, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses M3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered antagonist/inhibitor hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor agonists will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells. Protocol for RGS4 validation screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15microg/ml Blasticidin, 400microg/ml G418, 200microg/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 microl/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 microl /well of 2 microM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 microl /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 microl of EC20 (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors. 14. Calculate the percentage of tested compounds with the following formula: Percentage (%)=100* (Ratio(cmpd)- AvgRatio(Buffer))/(AvgRatio(Carbachol)-AvgRatio(Buffer)); Percentage(%): percentage change of compound readout over those of negative controls (Buffer), Ratio(cmpd): Integrated ratio of the test compound. AvgRatio(Buffer): Integrated Ratio average of the negative controls with Buffer, Ratio(Carbachol): Integrated Ratio of Carbachol. 15. Outcome assignment:  If the compound (the average of the duplicates of the Percentage (%, avPercent) as readout) causes more than those of negative controls (Buffer) plus 5SD of negative controls (Buffer), the compound is considered to be active (Value=2). Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (Value=1). 16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Int(((Log(ABS(avPercent))-0.61)*60.4, avPercent, as in the result definition.  The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0. List of reagents 1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider) 2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Cat#10010049) 3.

Description:  A cell line containing the human 5-HT1a receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15) as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure 5-HT1a agonism. When the 5-HT1a receptor is agonized, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity is proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 5-CT at a concentration equal to its EC100. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human 5HT1a receptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-15 promiscuous coupling protein was used (Invitrogen, part K1083). Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 3 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 50ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.5 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 2% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Immediately after this step, 50 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells)was added to the appropriate wells. The selective 5HT1a agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was also added (50nL) to positive control wells to a final concentration of 1.25 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation= ((test_compound- median_negative_control)/(median_positive_control - median_negative_control))*100 The negative control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the positive controls wells were treated with the Ec100 of 5-CT. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  This high-content imaging assay is developed and performed to confirm activity of hits originally identified in a high-content screen for antagonists of the GPR35 receptor, "Image-Based HTS for Selective Antagonists of GPR35" (AID 2058) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. The assay will identify small molecule antagonists of the GPR35 receptor.  This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further into coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10 mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) DMSO Working Solution: 100% DMSO 5) Agonist Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis #ALX-430-020-M010,10 mg) 5mM stock in DMSO diluted to 100 uM in PBS. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Agonist working solution (Zaprinast) was added to the entire plate except columns 1 and 24 (DMSO only as positive non-inhibition control). Zaprinast final concentration was 10 uM.  c. DMSO was added to column 1, 2 and 23, 24.  Final DMSO concentration was 0.31% d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm  mission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION - Threshold Adjustment:     4 - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   10 - Minimum Nuclear Area:    200 - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0 CYTOPLASM DETECTION - Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment: 0 - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.05 SPOT DETECTION - Spot Minimum Distance    3 - Spot Peak Radius     0 - Spot Reference Radius    3 - Spot Minimum Contrast    0.26 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   0.5 3) Metrics calculated from NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus") GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. IC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the HepG2 cell line which is derived from hepatocellular carcinoma. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the HepG2 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls.  Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen).  AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus that is spreading across Asia, Europe, and Africa. Since humans have no immunity against any H5 viruses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the economic impact of the next influenza pandemic could cost the United States billions of dollars, devastate the world economy and potentially kill one billion people worldwide. Thus, there is a critical need for antiviral drugs to supplement vaccine development and existing chemotherapeutics. A high throughput screening (HTS) approach provides an opportunity to screen large compound libraries. Here we use an adapted 384-well cell-based assay that measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by influenza virus infection, using a luminescent-based detection system for signal endpoint (1).  The HTS for inhibitors of the CPE exerted by H5N1 involves challenging MDCK cells with H5N1 virus at an MOI of 0.005 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. H5N1 has been constructed by reverse genetics and its susceptibility to ribavirin has been verified. The virus has been used to infect chicken eggs to yield allantoic fluid for use as a source of H5N1 in the HTS. The assay is carried out in 384-well plates with appropriate controls and cell survival is measured after 72 h using the Promega CellTiterGlo reagent, which measures cell viability in terms of cellular ATP concentration detected with firefly luciferase. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. Library compounds were screened at 50 uM. To follow up on single dose #hits# (>25% CPE inhibition) from the primary assay, these compounds will be evaluated in more detail by measuring their antiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity. This involves carrying out dose-response curves in triplicate over a 512-fold concentration range for cytotoxicity (uninfected cells) and antiviral activity (H5N1-infected cells).

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. This assay was previously used in a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign with 24,306 compounds to identify 181 with FPR binding activity (AID 440) and an additional 72 with FPRL1 binding activity (AID 441). The primary HTS assay was performed in 384-well format at a compound concentration of 6.7 microM. In the present study, the 252 compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the two primary HTS assays (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand binding) were tested in a dose response format to confirm activity and determine potency. The compounds were hit-picked at a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations. The FPR dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately (AID 519) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPRL1 binding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and specificity of compounds identified to have FPR binding activity in the FPR dose-response assay report (AID 520). For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. The fluorescent Wpep ligand had a Kd of 8 nanoM for FPRL1 and was used at a final concentration of 5 nanoM. Ki determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in the dose response assay.

Description:  Dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary HTS Assay for S1P3 Antagonists," (PubChem AID 485) and that confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify S1P3 antagonists," (PubChem AID 1429). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under the control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a BLA FRET substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will decrease well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and without antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day 50 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Next, S1P (0.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Prior to normalization data were corrected by subtracting #background# (ie, fluorescence values from wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = 100*(1-((Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control # Median_Ratio_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. Active compounds of this assay fall into the activity score range of 53 to 100 and inactive compounds have range of activity score from 0 to 50.

Description:  Dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)," (PubChem AID 793).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria:  1) they were active in AID 793;  2) they confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)" (PubChem AID 1257); and 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism." (PubChem AID 1256). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 uM. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (8 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of either test compound, High Control (BIIE0246, 0.28 uM final nominal concentration) or Low Control (DMSO, 0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T45 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control)))100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge High_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  A counterscreen assay was used to identify nonspecific compounds that inhibit protein synthesis independent of Stx action. Cycloheximide (Chx) readily diffuses into cells and immediately blocks protein synthesis in the absence of Stx. Stx actives that are active in the Chx assay are thus nonspecific compounds that stabilize luciferase activity Six million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced and the cells infected with 3 x109  plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well cyclohemixide (1 ug/mL final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After addition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX(TM)-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay media (DMEM as above except that the 10% v/v heat-inactivated bovine growth serum was replaced with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and no Zeocin was added).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed per test well of 1536-well plates (1000 cells/well), followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours.  After this incubation, 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (5 uM final nominal concentration; 0.5% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of PBS (control wells) or galanin in PBS (positive control wells; 1 uM final concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1 microliter per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol).  After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, luminescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 1 microliter of galanin. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. % Activation values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS screen for compounds effecting the binding of fluorscent GTP to various Ras-related GTPases yielded a number of interesting compounds. In this assay a number of compounds and their effect on different target proteins were assessed in a dose response manner under different conditions than the primary screen. For this assay, the binding buffer has 1 milliM MgCl2 buffer (the primary screen were carried out in 1 milliM EDTA buffer).  Individual protein targets (4 microM) are bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Binding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with 1 milliM MgCl2 and either DMSO or test compound (6 point 10-fold dilution series 100 microM to 0.02 microM) and subsequently adding 50 microL of a fixed concentration (1.5 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population.  Calculations: The binding measurements for each protein target were normalized to the amount of binding in DMSO alone: %Response = 100*(MCF/MCFwDMSO) where MCF is the binding of fluorescent GTP at different concentrations of test compound and MCFwDMSO is the binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of DMSO alone. The different %Response values were fit to 4-parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope: %Response= Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 +10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope)) where Bottom and Top are estimates of minimum and maximum of %Response over the concentration range of test compounds, LogEC50 is the log of the Effective Concentration of test compound yielding 50% change in the %Response, and HillSlope is variable slope of the dose response curve. Target_SCORE is based on the comparison of the estimated EC50 to the least amount of acceptable EC50, 20 microM, for compounds that had a magnitude of change greater than 15%. Thus Target_SCORE = 100*(1 - (EC50inMicroM/20) where EC50inMicroM is the calculated estimate of EC50 in microM. Active compounds have Target_SCORE greater than 0. The desired outcome was to find compounds with specific Cdc42 activity, however many compounds also affected other protein targets, namely Rac1. Thus the overall PUBCHEM_SCORE was left at 0 and compounds were designated 'inconclusive' due to this mixture of activity.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the SH-SY5Y cell line which is derived from human neuroblastoma. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the SH-SY5Y cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The biology of S1P receptor subtypes. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for purchased structural analogues of a S1P3 agonist (SID 7967985) identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "S1P3 Agonist Dose-Response Potency Assay" (PubChem AID 439).  In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by agonist induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity.  BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 agonist will increase well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 10 micromolar. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone, or S1P (1 uM final nominal concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 6 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells.  The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.  Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control) / (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control))*100 Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation. The pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain typically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly reversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of enzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of enzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating the ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a wide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has recently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6]. To identify inhibitors of USP2a a cell-free assay was employed. This is assay is a counterscreen used for the for the USP2a-PLA2 coupled assay. In this assay the murine PLA2 reporter enzyme is screened alone using NBD C6-HPC (Invitrogen) as a fluorogenic substrate. The assay buffer, prepared fresh at the day of the assay, contains 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM CaCl2, 2mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DMSO. 3ul of 10nM (5nM final) free PLA2, which is stored on ice, is dispensed into a medium-binding black solid Kalypsys 1,536 well plate using the Aurora BioRaptr. The assay plate is then pinned with 23nL compound with the Kalypsys pintool. The controls were pinned as follows: row 31 2M NEM and row 32 DMSO. Subsequently, 3uL 40uM (20uM final) NBD C6-HPC (stored on ice and protected from light) were dispensed into the plate using the BioRaptr dispenser. Plates were read immediately on an Envision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader using wavelengths of Ex 460nm /Em 535nm. Then, the assay plates were incubated for 2.5 hours and read again on the Envision using the same settings. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (NEM). Concentration-response curves were fitted to the normalized data and the concentration-response curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. The time zero reading was used to flag fluorescence artifacts.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell line creation and culture of the human mGluR4/ Gqi5/CHO line. Human mGluR4 (hmGluR4)/CHO cells were stably transfected with the chimeric G protein Gqi5 in pIRESneo3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and single neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened for mGluR4-mediated calcium mobilization using the method described below. hmGluR4/CHO cells were cultured in 90 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 10 percent dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 ug/ml proline, 2 mM glutamine, 400 ug/ml G418 sufate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 5 nM methotrexate (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise noted. Potency determinations. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Human mGluR4/Gqi5/CHO cells (30,000 cells/20 ul/well) were plated in black-walled, clear-bottomed, TC treated, 384 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, North Carolina) in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Plating Medium). The cells were grown overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 percent CO2.  The next day, the medium was removed and replaced using a Thermo Fisher Combi (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) with 20 uL of 1 uM Fluo-4, AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prepared as a 2.3 mM stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 10 percent (w/v) pluronic acid F-127 and diluted in Assay Buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)) for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compounds were transferred to daughter plates using an Echo acoustic plate reformatter (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) and then diluted into Assay Buffer to generate a 2x stock. Ca2+ flux was measured using the Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS6000, Hamamatsu, Japan). Baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm, emission, 540+/-30 nm) and then 20 ul/well test compounds were added using the FDSS's integrated pipettor. For concentration-response curve experiments, compounds were serially diluted 1:3 into 10 point concentration response curves in DMSO and were transferred to daughter plates using the Echo. 20 ul of test compounds (2X concentration) were applied and followed 2.5 minutes later by an EC20 concentration of glutamate (10 ul of a 5x final concentration). An EC80 concentration of glutamate was added 2 minutes later (12 ul of a 5x final concentration). Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Compounds with average EC50s greater than or equal to 30uM were assigned as 'Outcome' equals 'Inactive'. For compounds with average EC50s less than 30uM, 'Outcome' equals 'Active.' The 'Score' for 'Active' compounds was as follows EC50 <30 to >= 10uM equals '25', EC50 <10 to >= 1uM equals '50' and EC50 <1uM equals '100'.

Description:  Fluorescence counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: Cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the identification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide novel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1546), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704) were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control )/ ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y2 Potentiator Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for inactive compounds is 100-0. There are no actives.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-026) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 2152). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies and energy transfer from Europium to XL-665, leading to inhibition of well FRET. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of 10-points serial dilutions of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = ( I[671nm] / I[617nm] ) x 10,000 Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50/ greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive 73-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay for agonists of NPY-Y1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Therefore, the identification and characterization of small molecule modulators of NPY signaling and high affinity selective ligands for NPY receptors may prove useful for understanding NPY-associated human disease. The purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y1 potentiation dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1 (AID 1304), "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1546), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as a potentiator or agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactive 1-0.

Description:  The intraerythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs two cytosolic neutral aminopeptidases, an M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (M1AAP) and an M17-family leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP), in the terminal stages of host hemoglobin digestion. Their action results in the release of free amino acids that are used for the anabolism of parasite proteins and, hence, are critical to the development of the parasite in red blood cells. Inhibitors of the two exopeptidases prevent the growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro, and protect mice from infection with rodent malaria P. chabaudi, providing strong evidence that these enzymes are targets which can be used to develop new anti-malarial drugs.  Thus, Plasmodium falciparum M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (M1AAP) is an attractive chemotherapeutic target and was used to screen a large (200K) chemical library to identify novel inhibitors as probes for this enzyme in Plasmodium falciparum.  A simple assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) was used for quantifying the activity of M1AAP. The rate of hydrolysis of this substrate was measured by monitoring the release of the -NHMec fluorogenic leaving group at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that fluoresce at these wavelengths. A total of 217,208 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 30 uM.  For follow-up testing, the 1104 most potent inhibitors were tested in a dose response assay at concentrations ranging from 100-1.0 uM. M1AAP Assay Protocol for 1536-well HT Purified recombinant M1AAP enzyme was provided by Prof. John Dalton, Institute for the Biotechnology of Infectious Diseases (IBID) University of Technology Sydney. Compound Dosing/Plating: For the primary screen 15 nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 1536-well black non-binding surface plates. This resulted in a concentration of 30 uM of compound in the assay.  For the follow up dose response assays 8 concentrations of each compound ranging from 100-1 uM were used. Assay Setup: 2.5 uL of M1AAP reagent mix, which included the fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) in assay buffer, was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 1536-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 2.5 uL of the M1AAP diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.1 mM H-Leu-NHMec and 50 ug/ml M1AAP diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% DMSO). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm at 35 second intervals for 315 seconds (10 readings). Each plate had 256 control wells in the eight outside columns with 128 wells containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 128 wells in which the M1AAP had been left out (background).

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor b (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. The purpose of this assay to use HTS to identify inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb-SMMHC, a potential therapeutic approach for inv(16) related leukemia. This assay is a counterscreen for the primary screening assay, AID 1434. This is accomplished by using a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the TR-FRET signal will be abated. Assay materials: 1) His6-tagged Runt domain of Runx (CBFa) and Venus-CBFb-SMMHC were provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA). 2) Tb-labeled anti-His antibody was purchased from Invitrogen 3) Fluorescent CBF a/b complex working solution: 125 nM Runx-His6 (CBFa), 62.5 nM Venus-CBFb-SMMHC in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM K2SO4, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, and 0.0125% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1h. 4) Positive control (PC) solution contained untagged CBFb-SMMHC added at 1.25 uM concentration to the CBFa/b working solution uHTS protocol: 1) 4 uL CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 48 of a white 1536 well plate 2) 4ul of positive control is added to the wells in columns 1 and 2. 3) 40nl of 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns 1 through 4, while 40nl of 2mM compounds in 100% DMSO is added to wells in columnsd 5 through 48.  Final compound concentration is 20uM, final DMSO concentration is 1%. 4) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 5) The plate is read on a BMG Pherastar using a Lanthascreen filter set: 337ex, 520em and 490em 6) TR-FRET is determined as the ratio of 520/490 signals. Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were 2-fold serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.  2) 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 3) 16 ul of CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 24 of a black 384-well plate (Greiner #784076) 4) 16 ul of positive control is added to columns 1 and 2. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) The plate is read on a BMG Pherastar using a Lanthascreen filter set: 337ex, 520em and 490em 7) TR-FRET is determined as the ratio of 520/490 signals.

Description:  Full deck counterscreen for positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1): Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify nonselective activators and assay artifacts using the parental CHOK1 cell line. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that non-selectively modulate endogenous CHO-K1 cell GPCRs or that interfere with the assay format or calcium signaling. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify positive allosteric modulators of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)" (AID 588819). This assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay, parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8 fluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds, a basal read, addition of ATP (EC20), and measurement of well fluorescence. As designed, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of ATP. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck counterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-54, and for inactive compounds 53-0. List of Reagents: Cell line: Parental CHOK1 cell line (Conn Lab) Calcium sensitive dye: Fluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit; (AAT Bioquest, part 36316) Growth media: Ham's F-12; 10% FBS, 20mM HEPES Assay media: Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES Assay plates: Aurora black/clear 1536well FLIPR plate; (Aurora, part 00019326) Probenecid: 250mM (pH 8.0); (Sigma P8761) Potentiator: ATP (50mM stock in water); Sigma A9187

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.  This image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 10uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5mM stock diluted to 5uM in water. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Dynorphin final concentration was 1uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2.  Naloxone final concentration was 500nM.  d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml.

Description:  A modified strain of Vibrio harveyi with constitutive on quorum sensing system will be exposed to small molecules identified from the HTS screen used to identify LuxS inhibitors and LuxPQ antagonists. Growth of the organism post exposure will be followed using optical density and disruption of down stream quorum sensing elements will be observed  based on decreased luminescent signal. Expected Outcome: Identification of AI-2 quorum sensing system inhibitors with modes of action which either antagonize the LuxPQ receptor or inhibit LuxS synthase.  Such inhibitors should not perturb growth (observed by optical density) nor the constitutive on quorum sensing (observed by luminescence).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-003) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Primary Cell Based High Throughput Screening Assay for Agonists of GALR2 NFAT-BLA-CHO cells with the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter were stably transfected with plasmids expressing the rat GALR2. When cells were agonized with galanin/agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. Test compounds were screened for activation of GALR2 as measured by BLA activity. Hit compounds were counterscreened to eliminate direct BLA activation. The 5H9 GALR2-NFAT-BLA-CHO cells were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dish (Corning, part 430167) at 37C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media with GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen, part 10566-024) containing 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 1 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 100 ug/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen, part 45-0430) and 1X penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-163). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.3 million/mL in the assay media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media with GlutaMAX-I containing 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, and 25 mM HEPES). The HTS assay began by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of the assay plates (Griener LV 384-well, part 788092) and incubating for 20 hours. Then 1.1 uL of test compound, DMSO control (for negative control wells) or 10X galanin (10 uM, for positive control wells) was added. The plates were incubated at 37C for 4 hrs and then loaded with 1 uM CCF4/AM. The plates were incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature in dark. Thereafter, the plates were read using the EnVision multi-label reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm & 590 nm. The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % activation= ((test_compound - median_negative_control)/(median_postitive_control - median_negative_control))*100 A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  A cell line containing the human 5-HT1a receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15) as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure 5-HT1a agonism. When the 5-HT1a receptor is agonized, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity is proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. . The assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for positive control wells) was added. The selective 5HT1A agonist, 5-CT was also added to negative control and test compound wells to a final concentration of 70 nanomolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% of maximal activity. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs.After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added to all wells. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, plate fluorescence was measured with the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Prior to calculating percent activation, each channel of raw fluorescence data was corrected by subtracting the median fluorescence value of "background" wells containing media and substrate only. The ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was then calculated for each well. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/(median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 The positive control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the negative controls wells were treated with the EC80 of 5-CT. For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This result in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Pyruvate kinase (L. Mexicana) (LmPK) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) sulphate-free preparation from University of Edinburgh, UK and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of enzyme mix (kept on ice) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) containing PEP (0.5 mM final concentration) and LmPK (0.1 nM final concentration) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of ADP mix in assay buffer (r.t; 0.1 mM final ADP concentration) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme). To monitor activation, the first column contained a five-fold concentration of LmPK (0.5 nM).

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for agonists of NPY-Y1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1710), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (PubChem AID 1703), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862) were nonselective due to inhibition of NF-kappaB. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). In this assay inhibition of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that stably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce TNF-alpha-mediated induction of NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in NF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit NF-kB activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. The STAT3 inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin and 1 microgram/mL of puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 microliters of cell suspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5%CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The assay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received MG-132 (100 micromolar final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH. Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration resulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, the plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH. The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader. The percent inhibition was defined using the following mathematical formula:

Description:  Regulation of the differentiation and activity of inflammatory cells through cytokine signaling is essential for proper immune function and to prevent auto-immune disease and leukemias (1, 2). The protein tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is critical for this process (3-6). Following activation of cytokine receptors, particularly erythropoietin and interferon receptors, JAK2 phosphorylates transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, leading to expression of target genes involved in immune cell homeostasis (2, 3). The discovery of acquired genetic mutations in the JAK2 gene in hematopoetic cells from patients with Myeloid Proliferative Disorders (MPDs) characterized by excess proliferation of differentiated bone marrow myeloid cells (7-10), provided insights into the role of JAK2 in hematopoiesis. The identified JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) replaces guanine with thymine, resulting in a valine to phenylalanine amino acid substitution at codon 617 within the pseudokinase JH2 autoinhibitory domain (7-10). The resulting JAK2V617F variant is constitutively active, mediating JAK-STAT signaling efficiently even in the absence of ligand. Thus, the discovery of small molecules that can differentially inhibit JAK2V617F and not wildtype JAK2 may provide insights into JAK2 signaling in hematopoiesis and MPD pathogenesis (11, 12). Following the screening campaign (AIDs 1446, 1486, 1520, 1521, 1691, and 1699), certain compounds were identified as possible candidates for probe development. Compounds of interest were reordered as powders, and analogs were purchased or synthesized and tested in assays to determine potency (Assay 1), cytotoxicity (Assay 2), and selectivity (Assays 3-4). The probe development effort based on the hits from the HTS screening campaign resulted in no improvement over the prior art. No probes were identified and the SRIMSC probe development effort for this project has now stopped. Details of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in PubChem at the respective AIDs listed below. JAK2V617F Inhibition Assay (Assay 1): The purpose of these assays is to determine whether purchased or synthesized analogs of the original HTS hits act as inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617 kinase. This assay employs the same protocol as AID 1691. This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is cytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell viability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. Ba/F3 Cell Line Cytotoxicity Counterscreen Assay (Assay 2): The purpose of these assays is to determine whether compounds of interest were nonselective inhibitors due to cytotoxicity of the parental Ba/F3 cell line. This assay employs the same protocol as AID 1699. In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit cell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. irf1 Inhibition Assay (Assay 3): The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617F activity. This assay employs CellSensor irf1-bla human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells which stably express a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 response element from the interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). HEL cells are growth factor independent and contain an endogenous homozygous JAK2V617F mutation which leads to constitutive STAT5 activity. Due to the constitutive STAT5 activity in these cells, irf1-bla HEL cells constitutively express beta-lactamase. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of the LiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of fluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As designed, compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617 activity will reduce irf1 promoter activity, leading to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the 447/520 ratio. The dose response assay was run in triplicate in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. irf1 Inhibition Counterscreen Assay (Assay 4): The purpose of this assay is to identify nonselective active compounds from the previous screen. This assay employs CellSensor irf1-bla mouse pro B (Ba/F3) cells which stably express a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 Response Element present in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). Ba/F3 cells are growth dependent on IL-3 and have an intact IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of the LiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of fluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As designed, compounds that inhibit the IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway will lead to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the 447/520 ratio. The dose response assay was run in triplicate in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 micromolar.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected using a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in 1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's software data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol: (1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The calcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. (3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 to 120 min. (4) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000. (5) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. (6) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. Record agonist response for 210 s. (7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM NPS). Record antagonist response for 140 s.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5 mM stock diluted to 5 uM in water. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Naloxone final concentration was 5 uM.  c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 6) SNC80 was added to the entire plate except column 23.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM. Plates were then incubated for another 45 minutes. 7) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  8) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 9) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 10) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 11) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml.

The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in a uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the KOR receptor. This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10mg - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 oC and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the Jurkat cell line which is derived from human T cell leukemia. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the Jurkat cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. 1. Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing M4 receptor and Gqi5 were plated at 25,000 cells/well in assay media (DMEM (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X Non-essential Amino Acids (NEAA), 1 mM Na pyruvate) in 384 well plates. 2. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3. Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 2.0 uM Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4. Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5. Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nm excitation and 540 nm emission filters. 6. 10 micromolar test compound in assay buffer + 0.1 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7. Subsequently, 0.8 nanomolar acetylcholine (EC20) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8.  0.1% DMSO, compound vehicle, and 80nM acetylcholine (ECMAX) were added to each plate as controls. Data Processing: 1.  Minimum and maximum fluorescence intensities were selected from the time window ranging from the initial imaging of the cell plate (0 seconds) to 196 seconds. 2.  The minimum fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the maximum fluorescence intensity to give 'Value'. 5.  Compounds selected with 'Score' of '100' and 'Outcome' of 'Active' had values that differed in duplicate from the mean DMSO vehicle distribution at 99.7% confidence level. Compounds with 'Score' of '50' and 'Outcome' of 'Discrepant' different from the mean DMSO vehicle in only one of the two replicates. 6.  All calculations were done on a per plate basis using Pipeline Pilot with the R statistics package.

Description:  Low molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of misfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby enhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Using normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule inhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms.  Two pro-fluorescent substrates were chosen for two screens against a small molecule library.  One beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The second assay used Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside, generating a blue fluorescent product. The Km for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside and Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside were determined to be 71.2 uM and 855 uM, respectively. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, were determined to be 87.5 uM and 117 uM, respectively. The use of two difference pro-fluorescent substrates in the screens helped to eliminate false positives. All compounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s). Data normalization and AC50 calculations were accomplished using GeneData software. Both enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium taurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both assays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a final concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM. This particular assay protocol is for the "blue" substrate, and it was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: Blue fluorescence substrate assay: 2 uL enzyme 20 nL compound 1 uL substrate (final concentration of 80 uM) Incubate at room temperature (RT)  for 40 minutes 3 uL stop solution (1 M NaOH and 1 M glycine in water) Read the plate in Viewlux plate reader (Ex=365(10) and Em=440(10)).

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) or EC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay confirms compound activity in a cell-based assay of MLL leukemia cell growth inhibition using three different cell lines: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6), and KOPN-8 (MLL-ENL). Inhibition of cell proliferation in the MLL leukemia cells: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6) KOPN-8 (MLL-ENL) induced by compound measured after 72h treatment, as detected by the MTT cell viability assay. DMSO vehicle and Staurosporin were used as negative and positive control, respectively, in these experiments. Protocol for MTT assay. Cells were plated in 90 uL of culture medium in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates (Fisher Scientific) at concentrations of 1 x 105/ml. Cells were treated with 0.25% sterile DMSO (Sigma) or serial dilutions of compounds from 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO (all final concentrations of 0.25% DMSO). Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C for 72h. A Vybrant MTT cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes) was employed. Plates were read for absorbance at 570 nm using a PHERAstar BMG microplate reader. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate and mean values are reported.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. MEK protein was obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinase TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening assay for inhibitors of the Retinoic Acid Receptor-related orphan receptor A (RORA)" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information on the primary screen can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID=561. Among 278 compounds selected during the primary screening, 273 compounds were assessed in dose-response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. As with the primary screen, the dose-response assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor RORA (encoded by the pFA-hRORA plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hRORA and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated RORA nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential inhibitors of the RORA nuclear receptor. This assay was conducted in 1536-well format.

Description:  Cultured human SK-BR-3 breast tumor cells were treated with test compounds from a set of 40,000 compounds for 18-24 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM. Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminesence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control. Compounds that reduced cell viability to less than or equal to the median viability minus 3 times the standard deviation were scored as active.

Description:   As with the primary HTS assay, the same cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism. When the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by S1P agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha-16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. In this assay, in order to measure antagonist activity, test wells containing cells were treated with the Ec80 of the agonist S1P which was 800nM. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment, 209 compounds that passed hit selection criteria, were tested for individual IC50 determination. Compounds that were unavailable for "hit picking" were not followed up on. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations . Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. The entire campaign was run with the Ec80 of S1P as the negative control (0% Inhibition) Vs basal cells as the positive control (100% inhibition). All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of media only; i.e. 0% activation which should be concordant with 100% inhibition. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (49.8 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-16 pathway coupling protein was used. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 2 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122). Prior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2. The next day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of S1P [Ec80] was added to test wells and was also added to the appropriate negative control wells to a final concentration of 0.8 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the negative control signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.  This image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.

Description:  Of the current available drugs against influenza A virus, two target the M2 proton channel [1]. These are the adamantane-based compounds Amantadine and its close analogue Rimantadine. The M2 protein includes a 24-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a 19-residue hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 54-residue cytoplasmic tail. A number of biophysical and computational studies strongly suggest that M2 forms a homotetrameric transmembrane alpha-helical bundle that acts as a proton channel. Here, the channel s activated at lower values (pH  6.2) and it is closed at physiological pH. This function has been attributed to the H37 residue located in the channel pore. As anticipated above, this pH regulation by the M2 proton channel is fundamental to the virus life cycle. Following virus endocytosis and endosome the M2 activation induces acidification that weakens the bonds between the viral RNA and the virus capsid stimulating its release. Conversely, during virus exit, the M2 channel prevents acidification of the exosome which would cause premature and irreversible conformational changes of the viral hemagglutinin. Hence, the development of molecules capable of blocking the M2 channel represent an effective and attractive strategy for anti-influenza drugs. However, the use of currently available drugs against the M2 receptors, Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) and Rimantadine rather limited since the 1960s, due to several side effects, due to the inhibition of the human NMDA receptor, and the appearance of amantadine-resistant viral strains that contain single amino acid substitutions in the M2 protein. Two of the most recurring mutations that conferred amantadine resistance are localized to the transmembrane domain of the protein, the site of binding of amantadine, are S31N and V27A. The first has been shown to reduce the size of the pore thereby preventing the binding of Amantadine. The second has been shown to weaken the binding of Amantadine by reducing the interaction interface between the drug and the interior of the pore. The scope of this project was to screen for small molecules capable of binding to the M2 V27A proton channel in an in vitro binding assay with a reconstituted channel in lipids and to subsequently verify that this binding results in inhibition of viral replication. Unfortunately, no viable hits were identified 1. Sample preparation The TM domain (22-46) of influenza A virus M2 ion channel was synthesized by Anaspec with purity >95%. The peptide was dissolved in DPC (at a peptide/DPC concentration ratio of 1:100). The final test samples were dilute with 100mM phosphate buffer (%95/5% H2O/D2O, pH 8.15) to obtain 25 uM of the tetrameric M2 channel. The sequence of the peptide used was 22-SSDPLAVAASIIGILHLILWILDRL -46 (MW 2700), hence including the V27A mutation that is amantadine resistant. 2. Compound Library Screened by NMR We have assembled a scaffold library composed of ~ 4,000 compounds. The compounds have been selected based on their anticipated use as building blocks or scaffolds components of further optimized molecules. The scaffold library has been acquired from three different sources and the chemical structures of the library have been deposited into PubChem. In line with the general NIH Molecular Libraries Screening Centers Network (MLSCN) library, we have also included a collection of 602 Natural Products (MicroSource) that could be screened by NMR 3. NMR Based Screening description A. Ligand binding was monitored by comparing side chain amino proton peak of the tryptophan residue (~10.5ppm) of a 25 uM M2 channel solution (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.15 containing 95%/5% H2O/D2O; T= 300 K) in the presence and in absence of compounds tested at a final concentration of 1000 uM. Compounds were initially tested at mixtures of 20, and then individual compounds for those mixtures that caused significant perturbations of the tryptophan peak were further deconvoluted.  No significant hits were reported by this screen and compounds are with an estimated Kd > 4000 uM.

Description:  ER stress is a cellular response initiated by unfolded protein accumulation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Prolonged ER stress induces cell death with a form of apoptosis, and this cell death is related with various pathogenic pathways of disease like neurodegeneration, diabetes, vesicular disease etc. A series of benzodiazepine hits was originally identified in a HTS assay for inhibitors of ER stress-induced Cell Death (AID 1010) and confirmed in dose-response assay (AID 1247). Thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer, was used in both assays to trigger cell death in CSM14.1 cells. This assay was designed and performed in the laboratory of the assay provider to test if there is dose dependent inhibition of P38 MAPK phosphorylation by two of the benzodiazepine hits confirmed in AID 1247.  The CIDs were 2891837 and 2879344.  Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was determined using quantitative ELISA of treated CSM 14.1 cell extract.  p38 MAPK has been reported as an apoptotic transcription factor

Description:  Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer, genetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor suppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is essential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer therapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search for homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step of HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and stimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. Our goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as chemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer therapies. DNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51 protein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this assay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides (47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm and the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with the sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the photon emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an increase in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the duplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA strand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this fluorescence. We have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI and their dose-response is reported here. Materials Human Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence assay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer salts were from Sigma. Assay hRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min). Compounds (8.5 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by addition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min and then plates were read on Envision plate reader. Dose response protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop 3.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool 4. Add 4 ul reaction mix (containing hRad 51 and ss DNA with buffers) 5.Preincubate compound with the reaction mix for 30 min at room temperature 6. Add 2 ul ds DNA 7.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min 8.Read fluorescence on Envision reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 520 nm) Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (DMSO, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (heterologous DNA) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 85 uM to 2.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from archaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances of transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can restore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when polyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated expression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity phenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin, tau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in the appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to the proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of alternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates. A role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that the heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting a role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct relationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock proteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues of affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of Hsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High throughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat shock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and may lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders.  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1203). In this assay induction of the heat shock response by test compound is measured in a HeLa cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter under control of the human Hsp70 promoter.  As designed, a compound that activates the Hsp70 promoter will increase luciferase transcription, and thus increase well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hsp70.1pr-luc HeLa cell line was routinely cultured in tissue culture flasks in growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% pen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture and 1% Geneticin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 750,000 cells/mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (3,750 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound in DMSO to sample wells, DMSO alone (1% final concentration) to negative control wells, or MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to positive control wells. The plates were then incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:        To identify novel compounds that act as effective ER-alpha coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay has been developed in a 384 well format.  This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with the LBD of ER-alpha, which is induced in the presence of an agonist like estradiol, brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.  Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays. 1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add 0.5 uL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. Final concentration of each compound is 25.6 uM. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-alpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. 3. Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives.

Description:  Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by mutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this pathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single gene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer the LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable overlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within each type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2 (Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5 yrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. CDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of Man-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is not effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI reaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia) will benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic flux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a non-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting; however, identification of chemical probes with diverse modes of action (MOA) would be advantageous for further characterization of PMI and PMM variants.  The purpose of this assay is to identify inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its product, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with NADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. This assay is performed in the presence of near-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate, mannose-6-phosphate, to ensure the identification of inhibitors with diverse MOAs. PMI assay materials: 1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml Diaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin. 3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6 ug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. PMI HTS protocol: 1) 2 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-48 of a Costar 1536-well black plate (cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser 2) 2 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) of a Costar 1536-well black plate (cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser 3) 40 nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1-4 using a HighRes biosolutions pintool and V&P Scientific pins 3) 40 nL of 2 mM compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed in columns 5-48 using a HighRes biosolutions pintool and V&P Scientific pins 4) 2 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 5) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 6) After 20 minutes the plates were read on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer), Ex544, Em590. 7) The screening was performed using a HighRes biosolution fully integrated HTS POD-based system 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). PMI Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate (cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix) 2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive control) 3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4) 2 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 5) 9 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. 6) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 7) The plates were read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices), Ex544, Em590. 8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonists: cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO cell line. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that non-selectively inhibit Gq signaling. In this assay, the parental CHO cell line (not transfected with any GPCRs) is used to monitor inhibition of Gq activity by test compound. Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP). A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-22, and for inactive compounds 61-0.

Description:  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein SMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2 which are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips exon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2 protein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1 locus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form, it is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy that either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has been proposed for the treatment of SMA. We have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional SMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that inclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus generating functional luciferase enzyme. This screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter with the major portion of the native SMN2 cDNA (exons 1 -7, intron 8 , exon 8 fused to luciferase) stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Compounds that increase luciferase signal presumably enhance expression of the functional SMN2 splice variant.

Description:  To assign functional characteristics to compounds identified in our previous binding and dose-response screens, a functional assay to assess estrogen-mediated translocation of PIP3 was employed. This assay uses the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (Protein kinase B). This PH domain binds specifically to PI(3,4,5)P3 and, when fused to RFP, can be used as a reporter of PIP3 localization in the cell at different points following stimulation. Stimulation of cells co-expressing ERbeta and PH-RFP with estrogen and other ERbeta agonists leads to a translocation of PH-RFP from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a nuclear localization. This translocation can be blocked using an ERbeta antagonist. Cos7 cells (ATCC # CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. 200,000 cells were seeded into 6- well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with ERbeta-GFP and PH-RFP at a ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, per manufacturers instructions). Six hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto 12 milliM glass coverslips (7500 cells / coverslip) and allowed to adhere for 18 hours, at which point media was changed and cells were grown in phenol-red free, serum-free DMEM F-12 containing Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine for 24 hours prior to assay. Transfected cells were stimulated with compound, vehicle or estrogen to assess PI3K translocation in response to estrogen-mediated signaling. To screen for agonist activity, compound was applied to cells and incubated at 37 degreesC for 15 minutes. For assessment of antagonist activity, cells were firs incubated with potential antagonist for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, then sitmulated with low-dose estrogen (10 nanoM) for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, washed 3x with PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were stored at -20 degreesC prior to visualization. Assessment of translocation of the PI3P reporter, PH-RFP, was visually scored. Compounds which fully translocated PH-RFP to the nucleus (equal to estrogen-mediated translocation) were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds with a moderate level of PH-RFP translocation were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 50 and compounds which induced no translocation of PH-RFP were assigned a value of 0. Scoring of antagonists was as completed in a similar manner, with compunds that completely blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, compounds which partially blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a score of 50, and all inactive compounds assigned a score of 0. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME was based on the activity scores, with "Active" compunds being those with PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCOREs of 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "In-active" compounds having a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0-50 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will decrease NFAT-BLA transcription and decrease well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 1% BSA (0.8 micromolar final nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( (Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses CRE-bla CHO cell line from Invitrogen. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the CRE-bla CHO cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen was used as positive control. The selected compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the Hek 293 cell line which is derived from human embryonic kidney cells (transformed with adenovirus). The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction.

Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the Hek293 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen).

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions . Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have RV less than 100. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. An active compound for RGS16 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 26 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  Novel reagents that inhibit the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation and subsequently the Amyloid beta protein production, that is elevated in Alzheimer's disease, could lead to the discovery of therapeutic drugs for the disease. MLSMR 160K library was screened for small molecules that suppress the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation by binding to the 5'Untranslated Region of the APP mRNA. It utilizes a stable neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y transfectants that express Luciferase under the translational control of 146 nucleotides from the 5'UTR of APP mRNA. It had been shown that this region forms a stem loop which is, in turn, a significant regulator of the APP levels in the brain (1, 2). The effects of compounds addition on APP levels is measured by quantification of luciferase expression levels with a bioluminescence assay system.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-005) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The assay described here is a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases are simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library.  The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.   Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-L) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) is a G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptor for chemokine CXCL13 and belongs to the CXC chemokine receptor family.  This assay was developed and performed as a selectivity assay for the primary assay originally identified as "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 493098 based on expression pattern compared to CCR6. A probe that is selective against CXCR5 (within equipotent range as defined by a >15-fold difference in IC50) is desired. In this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect antagonists that inhibit the activation of the CXCR5 receptor in the CHO-K1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 384-well plate format in secondary screening mode.

Description:  The fusion-active conformation of the envelope protein gp41 of HIV-1 consists of an N-terminal trimeric alpha-helical coiled coil domain, and three anti-parallel C-terminal helices which fold down the grooves of the coiled coil to form a six-helix bundle. Disruption of the six-helix bundle is considered to be a key component of an effective non-peptide fusion inhibitor. This structure forms as a result of a conformational change in gp41, triggered by gp120 and co-receptor binding to host cell receptors. Prevention of six-helix bundle formation has been recognized as an important mechanism for viral fusion inhibition A metallopeptide-based fluorescence assay has been developed to detect HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, by the screening of small molecules that bind to the hydrophobic pocket of gp41. The assay involves two peptides representing the inner N-terminal-heptad-repeat (HR1) coiled coil and the outer C-terminal-heptad-repeat (HR2) helical domains of the gp41 six-helix bundle which forms prior to fusion. The HR1 peptide is modified with a metal-ligated dye complex, which maintains structural integrity and permits association with a fluorescein-labeled HR2 peptide concomitant with fluorescence quenching. Compounds able to disrupt six-helix bundle formation can act as fusion inhibitors, and can be detected in the assay from an increase in the fluorescence that is correlated with compound's efficacy.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. The caspases represent an important class of drug targets for stroke, ischemia, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Comparison of crystal structures of procaspases and caspases have revealed that the subunits of the homodimer are composed of subdomains which have highly conserved architecture and mechanism, and show large structural transitions between procaspase and active conformers. One goal of this project was to identify compounds that act as allosteric inhibitors via stabilizing the procaspase form of the enzyme. Previous work in Well's laboratory has shown that such allosteric inhibitors can be identified and these act by binding at the dimer interface of enzyme. The biochemical assay was configured using purified caspase 1 at a high enzyme concentration to promote formation of the homodimers and thus facilitate the identification of allosteric inhibitors. The overall goal was to identify reversible inhibitors with better drug-like properties than the currently available set of aspartyl-containing peptidomimetics that covalently bind the active site. Caspase 1 was assayed using the profluorescent substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC. After initiation of the assay with substrate the plates were rapidly read using an automated robotic system (Kalypsys, Inc.) to maintain consistent timing. A kinetic mode of detection was used where the initial rate was collected (estimated final product formation was ~10%). Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 57 uM to 0.7 nM. Below is the protocol used for caspase 1. Caspase-1 was dispensed (3 mL) into a 1536-well black solid-bottom microplate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, USA) using a Bio-RAPTR (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) nanoliter dispenser for automated addition of reagents, to give a final enzyme concentration of 2 nM. Assay buffer was 50 mM HEPES, pH7.4, containing 1M sodium citrate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.01% CHAPS, 1% DMSO, and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). Aliquots of test compound (23 nL) from a DMSO stock solution were transferred to the enzyme-containing wells using a pintool transfer station (Kalypsys Inc., San Diego, USA), and the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Each compound was added as a 12-point titration in duplicate. Substrate was dispensed (1 mL) to give a final caged fluorescent peptide substrate (Ac-LEHD-AMC) concentration of 5 mm, and the initial reaction rate was monitored over 20 min at room temperature. Free AMC was measured by fluorescence detection (lex=340 nm, lem=450) with a ViewLux charge-coupled device-based imager (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median values of the uninhibited and the uncatalyzed controls, and IC50 values were determined by fitting the concentration-response data with a four-parameter Hill equation as previously described (http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts/curvefit/).

Description:  The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1-392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) for E. coli growth. Materials: 1)  Testing was done in Mueller-Hinton II broth (BBL). Protocols: 1) All compounds were first tested for their ability to limit cell growth of E. coli. 2) Compounds showing binding by NMR were tested over a range of concentrations. 3) E. coli growth in the presence of compounds were determined by mixing 90 uL of an OD600 = 0.001 with 10 uL of various concentrations of compound and grown overnight in a 96-well plate. 4) Optical density at 530 nm was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor 2 Multilabel plate reader. Since DnaK is required for growth under heat shock conditions, we tested the compounds ability to kill E. coli at 42 oC. 5) The MIC was read as the concentration producing a greater than 2-fold reduction in growth

Description:  Addiction leading to abuse should  be treatable by pharmacological approaches, and programs that identify new drugs to treat methamphetamine abuse address an immediate goal of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that new approaches are needed for treating METH addiction. Currently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the psychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity, psychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not lead to the development of tolerance. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin receptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses. We propose to identify novel small molecule neurotensin receptor agonists by screening libraries of compounds using a primary assay based upon the ability of a b-arrestin fluorescent reporter to directly recognize the activated state of the NTR1. A. Brief Description of the Assay: This assay is to confirm lead agonists from the primary screening results that activate the neurotensin receptor-1 pathway by detecting of spots of-arrestin-GFP in NTR1-U2OS Osteosarcoma Cells.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-M1)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-M1 and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes.  Data were normalized to the uninhibited controls.

Description:  Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man, annually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. Glucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite, the bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that HK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is lethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been unsuccessful. Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have been developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. T. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome 10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical. TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian HKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and human HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets. Indeed, it has been suggested that the possibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long sought-after inhibitors a possibility. Thus, a simple "mix and read" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the enzyme.  The TbHK1 assay was used to screen the NIH-SMR and the data has been posted on Pubchem. All primary actives were then counter screened using the G6DPH counterscreen (coupled assay) to remove chemotypes that interfere with the assay format.  G6PDH counter-screening assay protocol The basic screening procedure for the G6PDH HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture components (as follows): 1.  15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final concentration = 10 uM.) 2.  15 uL of a G6P and NAD+ mixture is added for a final concentration of 0.2 mM and 0.6 mM, respectively. 3.  15 uL of G6PDH enzyme is added per well (final concentration = 0.006 mUnits/uL). 4.  Reaction incubates for 1 hour at room temperature. 5.  5 uL EDTA is added to each well (final concentration = 50 mM). This assay was used as a counterscreen for the cherry picked compounds and was performed as a single concentration (10 uM). These compounds were also rescreened in the primary TBHK1 screen at a single concentration (10 uM).  ~212 compounds (out of 239) were available from DPI for subsequent follow up.

Description:  Memories persist for different lengths of time, from seconds or minutes to a lifetime. There are two kinds of memory: short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). STM lasts for minutes to hours, which maybe mediated by modifications of molecules involved in synaptic functions. LTM lasts for days or longer, and may be due to the formation of new synapses or restructuring of existing synapses. LTM, but not STM, requires gene transcription and synthesis of proteins. CREB (cyclic-AMP Responsive Element Binding Protein) is one of the candidates plays an important role for enhancement of some types of LTM. CREB, a family of transcription factors, regulates the transcription of genes containing cAMP Responsive Elements (CRE). CRE is a nucleotide sequence often found in the promoter regions of genes that are binding sites for CREB. Using a luciferase reporter-gene under control of cAMP responsive element, a cell-based assay [CRE-luc2P HEK293 developed by Promega] was used to measure forskolin-induced signaling. The selected compounds were measured for their ability to modulate positively the action of EC10 NKH 477, a water soluble forskolin, on reporter gene activity. Compounds were screened in a titration series in 1536-well format. Positive modulators were identified based on the AC50 values derived from the screening data. 2500 cells/5uL in DEME with 1% FBS was dispensed into 1536-well plates and cells were cultured at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. Next day 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, and 1uL of EC10 level of NKH 477, or EC100 level of IBMX, a PDE inhibitor, in the present of NKH 477, or assay medium was added. And then the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 4 hours. 6 uL of Bright-Glo luciferase (Promega, WI) was added to each well. After incubated at room temperature for 10min the plates were measured for luminescence intensity on a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) detector.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest for their ability to modulate calcium flux in a cell line expressing the Y381A mutant M1 receptor. Stable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing rat Y381A mutant M1 receptor were plated into 96-well Costar optical bottom assay plates at a concentration of 70K cells/well in 100 microliters of Ham's F-12 media.   Cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C (5% CO2).  The following day, medium was removed from cells and they were incubated in 50 microliters of Fluo-4 AM diluted in assay buffer (HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) for 1 hour at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 45 microliters of assay buffer.  Test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO-matched assay buffer at 2X concentration and 45 microliters was applied to a cell-containing assay plate in an automated format using the Flexstation (Molecular Devices).  Calcium flux was measured over time as an increase in fluorescence (fold over basal), and the max minus min values for each well were copied into a custom excel template, which normalized the data as a % of maximum response elicited by a high concentration of N-desmethyl-clozapine (NDMC). This data was then copied into Prism (version 4.0c), which fit the data to a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable slopes using no constraints or weighting.

Description:  Assay Submitter (PI): Jolanta Grembecka, Tomasz Cierpicki, University of Virginia Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay was run to confirm the activity of hits from the primary screen using the peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine (Eu3+-AB) and the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). FP Assay Reagents: 1. FP reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT. Before use, 0.05% BSA is added. 2. Menin protein, MLL-w.t. labeled with fluorescein, MLL-mutant peptide labeled with texas red. Stored in singe use aliquots at -80C. 3. MLL-w.t. unlabeled peptide as positive control: 10 uM final in FP buffer. FP Assay Procedure: 1. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, and MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM mixture in FP buffer. 2.

Description:  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein SMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2 which are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips exon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2 protein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1 locus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form, it is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy that either increases the amount of SMN2 product made increases the inclusion of exon 7 has been proposed for the treatment of SMA. We have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional SMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that inclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus generating functional luciferase enzyme. One potential source of false positives in the primary screening assay is stabilization of the reporter luciferase via direct binding. This assay attempts to identify such compounds by screening directly for luciferase activity in the absence of the cellular system. The primary screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter and splicing based cassettes in tandem with the major portion of the native SMN1 cDNA, and then transfected into HEK293 cells. Compounds that modulate luciferase signal presumably modulate expression of native SMN1 expression. In this assay, we utilize purified firefly luciferase in lieu of a cellular reporter to identify compounds interacting directly with luciferase in the primary screen.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones. These results comprise confirmation of hits from primary screening in a purified enzyme assay. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at 440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). In the AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR).

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that inhibit KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) potassium channels. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit KCNQ2 potassium channels. This assay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were measured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit. Those CHO-K1 cells stably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed by the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound has a B-score of less than minus 3*SD of the average B score of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channel. Protocol for the KCNQ2 project: 1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells. 5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness. 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on the Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), ICmax of XE-991  (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds). 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system. 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in darkness. 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4. 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline. 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds. 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0. 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [13]. 16. Calculate B scores [14] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more negative than -3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=-3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 2 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of INT(100*LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio)), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio), B Score inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. 1.  Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing M1 receptor (ATCC #CRL-1985) were plated at 10,000 cells/well in assay media (F12 (Ham), 10% FBS, 2 millimolar GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 20mM HEPES) in 384 well plates. 2.  The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3.  Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 millimolar HEPES, 2.5 millimolar Probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 4.0 micromolar Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4.  Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5.  Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nanometer excitation and 540 nanometer emission filters 6.  10micromolar test compound in assay buffer + 0.1 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7.  Subsequently, 0.8 nanomolar acetylcholine (EC20) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8.  0.1% DMSO, compound vehicle, and 80nM acetylcholine (ECMAX) were added to each plate as controls. Data Processing: 1.  Minimum and maximum fluorescence intensities were selected from the time window ranging from the initial imaging of the cell plate (0 seconds) to 196 seconds. 2.  The minimum fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the maximum fluorescence intensity to give 'Value'. 3.  Compounds selected with 'Score' of '100' and 'Outcome' of 'Active' had values that differed in duplicate from the mean DMSO vehicle distribution at 99.7% confidence level. Compounds with 'Score' of '50' and 'Outcome' of 'Inconclusive' were different from the mean DMSO vehicle in only one of the two replicates. 4.  All calculations were done on a per plate basis using Pipeline Pilot with the R statistics package.

Description:  The glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3b) is a known master regulator for several cellular pathways and plays a critical role in metabolism, transcription, development, cell survival, and neuronal functions.  The overall objective is to identify one or multiple series of inhibitors of GSK-3beta with micromolar potency.  Such compounds will become probe(s) with demonstrated kinase-selectivity (&#8805;10-fold IC50) and activation of Wnt signaling (EC50 < 10uM) and desired effect on neuronal morphology. Structural series that demonstrates non-ATP competitive mechanism of action will be strongly preferred.  For primary screen, activity of 1.6 ng of GSK3beta (as a GST fusion from BPS Bioscience) was incubated with 10 uM of compounds in the presence of 25 uM of ATP (specific reaction conditions see Protocol) for 60 minutes at ambient temperature in 1536 plates (Aurora 29847).  The kinase activity was measured with ADP-Glo (Promega V9103) and signals were read with Viewlux (PerkinElmer). Positive control (GW8510 at 20 uM) was included in each plate and used to scale the data in conjunction with in-plate DMSO controls (details see Data Analysis or Comments section).   Expected Outcome: Inhibitors for GSK3beta activity will show as loss of luminescence signal. 1) Dispense 1 uL/well of CABPE, 0.5 uL of ATP, and 1 uL of positive control GW8510 or AB in respective wells according to plate design to 1536-well assay ready plates (Aurora 29847) that contain 2.5 nL/well of 10 mM compound using BioRAPTR (Beckman) to start the reaction.   Incubate at room temperature for 60 minutes. 2) Add 2.5 uL/well of ADP-glo (Promega, V9103) with BioRAPTR, incubate at room temperature for 40 minutes 3) Add 5 uL/well of ADP-glo (Promega, V9103) with Combi nL (Thermo), incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes 4) Read on Viewlux (PerkinElmer) for luminescence Solutions: AB: 25 mM Tris7.5 10 mM MgCl2 GW8510 (in AB, Sigma G7791) 50 uM GW8510 CABPE (in AB): 12.5 mM DTT (Sigma 43816) 0.25 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A4503) 0.5 U/ml Heparin (Baxter NDC 0641-2440-41) 8 uM Peptide (American Peptide) 23 nM GSK3beta (BPS Biosciences) ATP (in AB, Promega V9103 component): 125 uM ATP

Description:  Assay Overview: The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds synthesized to explore structure activity relationship of SID 14723044. This compound was identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to measure p97 ATPase inhibition" (PubChem AID 1481), and confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the p97 ATPase" (PubChem AID 1517). This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Prior to the start of the assay, 18 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2, rows O and P of 384-well assay plates. The remaining wells were filled with 18 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM p97 protein. Next, 50 nL of test compounds in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 100 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 20 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all wells and the plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and well luminescence was measured by the Envision microplate reader.

Description:  The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that autofluoresce under these conditions. Despite using a kinetic assay some compounds were too intensely fluorescent to be evaluated correctly and were not considered for follow up dose response studies. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for DPM-DC inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty non-autofluorescent compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited DPM-DC and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of DPM-DC. Diphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 384-well HTS Final Assay concentrations:  25 uL/well 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 4 mM MgCl2 0.4 mM ATP 5uM diphosphomevalonate (DPM) 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate 20 uM NADH 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (Sigma) 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (Sigma) 30 nM of DPM-DC 4% DMSO The assay was run in 384-well black opque plates.  Fifteen ul substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 ul volumes using the FX. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ul of DPM-DC using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in fluorescence was measured (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the MK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing DPM-DC with hexokinase.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput assay for inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F"(PubChem AID 1446), were nonselective inhibitors due to cytotoxicity of the parental Ba/F3 cell line. In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit cell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. The murine Ba/F3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS (v/v), 1ng/mL IL-3, and 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in phenol red free RPMI supplemented as above except with 2ng/mL IL-3. The assay was started by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each well. Next, 28 nL of test compound (5.60 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.56 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (5.6 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. After 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 5 microliters of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was added to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well luminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP. Activation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained and constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). Given its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been broadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK phosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These assays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. The current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform. AlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay platform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia). In the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring "donor" and "acceptor" beads to a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting donor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays consisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of target for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The compounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR mutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of the prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other important ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1. The HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR mutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled streptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in homogenous assay format. EGFR and EGFR mutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate. The HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme was preformed in 384 well format (data not included). All reagents were dispensed into 1536 well plates.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Compounds were tested at 10uM (fixed) in the presence of a submaximal concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) (~EC20) and evaluated for their ability to elevate the response to ACh in rM1-expressing CHO cells.  Compounds eliciting a response greater than approximately 50% of the maximum ACh response were considered 'Active.' Compounds with <50% response were considered 'Inactive.' Active compounds were assigned a 'Score' of '50' for 50-70% maximum response and '100' for >70% maximum response.

Description:  Late stage results from the probe development effort to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 9 (RBBP9): Gel-based Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) Inhibition. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). Furthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for the study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. This gel-based activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) inhibition assay was performed as part of a probe development effort to identify inhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester scaffold. Please see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this probe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in the uHTS primary (AID 1515) and confirmation screens (AID 1537). In this assay, a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction products are separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel using a flatbed fluorescence scanner. The percentage activity remaining is determined by measuring the integrated optical density of the bands. As designed, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe, leading to low fluorescence polarization in the band in the gel. Percent inhibition of recombinant RBBP9 (compound at 20 uM) was determined. Protocol Summary: Recombinant RBBP9 (2 mM) in assay buffer was incubated with DMSO or compound (20 mM) for 30 min at 25 degrees Celsius before the addition of FP-rhodamine at a final concentration of 75 nM in 50 ml total reaction volume. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at 25 degrees Celsius, quenched with 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min at 90 degrees Celsius, separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel. The percentage activity remaining was determined by measuring the integrated optical density of the bands. List of Reagents: Recombinant RBBP9 protein (provided by Assay Provider) FP-rhodamine (provided by Assay Provider) Sodium Chloride (Fisher, part 980597) 1M Tris, pH 8.0 (Invitrogen, part T-3038)

Description:  Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from intercept of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the baseline). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active (fluorescent) compounds showed concentration-dependent increase in the measured baseline.

Description:  The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors has been found primarily in most immune system cells and some other non-immune cells. NFAT plays the immunomodulatory role, primarily in T-cell activation and differentiation. NFAT target genes are also involved in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation in non-immune cell types. The NFAT sequence was engineered to the upstream of the ?-lactamase reporter gene and transfected into Jurkat cells with co-transfection of muscarinic receptor1 [provided by Invitrogen Corp]. When an extracellular stimulus, such as carbachol, binds to the GPCR M1 receptor, it stimulates a signaling cascade that activates NFAT response element and ?-lactamase expression by phosphorylating the NFAT binding protein. This cell based ?-lactamase reporter gene assay can accurately monitor any changes occurring along the NFAT pathway, and can be used for screening small molecule inhibitor or activator upon activation by carbachol EC50 concentration. A small molecular library were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (can be either IC50s or EC50s). The cells were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% dialyzed FBS and 25 mM HEPES at 1.6 x 106cell/ml. The assay was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: 5 ul of cell preparation 23 nl of compounds 1ul of carbachol (final concentration 1 uM) Briefly centrifuge the plates and incubate at 37#C for 5 hours 1 ul of CCF4 dye mixture Incubate the plates at RT for 1 hour  Read the plate in EnVision plate reader (Ex= 405nm, and Em1=460nm and Em2=530nm).  The %Activity was determined from the ratio of 460nm/530nm. Data normalization and AC50 calculations were accomplished using GeneData software.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of NPY-Y1. In this assay test compounds from the MLSCN library were screened for their ability to act as antagonists of the NPY-Y1 receptor (Y1). A cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure Y1 antagonism by test compound. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Increased CNGC activity increases the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. Addition of agonist (NPY peptide) counteracts isoproterenol action and reduces probe fluorescence. A test compound that acts as an effective Y1 antagonist will counteract NPY action, leading to increased cAMP levels, CNG channel opening, membrane potential, and therefore higher probe fluorescence. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3,600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above but without Geneticin and Puromycin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The assay was started by dispensing two microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (25 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final nominal concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final nominal concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((RatioTestCompound - MedianRatioHighControl)/ (MedianRatioLowControl - MedianRatioHighControl))]*100 Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. LowControl is defined as wells with DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. HighControl is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the counterscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Cells (wild-type or mutant) were plated and allowed to settle at 37C overnight. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of compound (final DMSO conc:0.25%) at 37C for 2 hrs. SteadyLite luciferase reagent was added, plates incubated for 30 mins and then read on Envision reader. Dose-response protocol 1.Fill 384 well plate with 24 uL of cells (wild-type or mutant) in DMEM (7500 cells per well) using Wellmate (all columns except 1 and 23) 2.Add 24 uL DMEM to columns 1 and 23 using Wellmate 3. Seal plates with Breathe-easy membranes and incubate at 37C overnight 4.Dilute 1 ul of compound from dose-response plate with 79 ul DMEM to get a diluted dose-response plate (top concentration 125 uM) 5. Add 6 ul of diluted compound to the overnight-grown cells, seal with Breathe-easy membrane and incubate at 37C for 2 hrs 6.Add 30 ul SteadyLite HTS reagent and incubate at room temperature for 30 min 7.Read luminescence on Envision reader Data analysis The data was analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each dose-response plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (wild-type or mutant cells, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no cells) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 25 uM to 0.75 nM. Percent enhancement of signal was calculated for each well from the signal in luminescence units (LU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % enhancement = 100*(((signal-blank mean)-( control mean-blank mean ))/(control mean-blank mean))) Dose response curves of percent enhancement were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic model).

Description:  BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB). These proteases reverse the conjugation of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions. In order to confirm the activity of hit compounds from the primary assay, an HPLC-based, end-point enzyme activity assay was developed. The assay monitors the hydrolysis of a simple ubiquitin conjugate (Ub-ethyl ester) by BAP1, leading to the release of free Ub.  After the reaction is quenched, the amounts of both Ub and UbEE present are quantified by reverse-phase HPLC.  The ratio of Ub and UbEE peak heights was used to determine % conversion (i.e. the conversion of UbEE to Ub), which reflects BAP1 activity.   10x assay buffer buffer (1x = 50 mM Tris HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5) Purified BAP1 (provided by investigator) Ub-ethyl ester (UbEE) substrate (2.2 mg/mL, provided by investigator) Test compounds (1 mM in 100% DMSO) 400 mM HCl Reaction procedure: 1. Reactions were prepared in 4 96-well round-bottom plates. 2. Prepare compound working stocks in 96-well plates (dilute 1mM compound 1:5 in 1x assay buffer). 3. Prepare BAP1 working stock (1uM) in 1x assay buffer 4. Prepare reaction plates in the following order (amounts per reaction): a. 10 uL dH2O b. 2 uL 10x assay buffer c. 2 uL BAP1 d. 2 uL compound (final [compound] = 20 uM) i. Control reactions received DMSO alone.  5. Preincubate substrate and compound for 5-10 minutes 6. Add 2 uL/well UbEE 7. Incubate plates at RT for 20 min. 8. Quench reactions by adding 4 uL 400mM HCl/well 9. Store reactions at -20C until analysis. HPLC procedure: Reactions (4 uL) were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Gilson HPLC using a 30 mm column (internal diameter = 2.1 mm, particle size = 3 um) Mobile phase = 52% B:48% A Buffer A = 40 mM sodium perchlorate + 0.1% perchloric acid Buffer B =  Buffer A + 75% acetonitrile 1 mL/min flow rate, 4-6 min run time.  Controls include: t = 0 (add HCl with substrate), DMSO-only (negative control), Ub-vinyl sulfone (known inhibitor = positive control).  Purified Ub and UbEE were used as retention time controls. Data analysis: Retention time, peak height, and peak area were determined for both Ub and UbEE using UniPoint software v. 5.11 (Gilson).  Compounds with Ub/UbEE peak height ratio >125% were discarded (7 total compounds). These compounds are labeled as inactive. For each compound, % conversion was determined based on peak heights: % conversion = [Ub/(Ub+UbEE)] * 100 Where appropriate, chromatograms were analyzed by hand to confirm results or if a potential hit had been overlooked because of integration program settings.  Peak area data has been omitted for these samples. For each compound, % control was calculated as the ratio of the compound % conversion to the mean % conversion for the plate. Compounds with % control less than or equal to 60% were identified as active. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was obtained by normalizing the % conversion values obtained between 100 and 0, with 100 corresponding to the lowest % conversion, and 0 to the highest % conversion, according to the formula: SCORE = 100 * (1-((Value - LowestConversion) / (HighestConversion - LowestConversion)))

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-013) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  A high throughput screening (HTS) approach provides an opportunity to screen large compound libraries. Here we use an adapted 384-well cell-based assay that measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by influenza virus infection, using a luminescent-based detection system for signal endpoint (1). The HTS for inhibitors of the CPE exerted by H5N1 involves challenging MDCK cells with H5N1 virus at an MOI of 0.005 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. H5N1 has been constructed by reverse genetics and its susceptibility to ribavirin has been verified. The virus has been used to infect chicken eggs to yield allantoic fluid for use as a source of H5N1 in the HTS. The assay is carried out in 384-well plates with appropriate controls and cell survival is measured after 72 h using the Promega CellTiterGlo reagent, which measures cell viability in terms of cellular ATP concentration detected with firefly luciferase. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. Library compounds were screened at 50 uM. To follow up on single dose hits (>25% CPE inhibition) from the primary assay, these compounds were evaluated in more detail by measuring their antiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity. This involved carrying out dose-response curves over a 512-fold concentration range for cytotoxicity (uninfected cells) and antiviral activity (H5N1-infected cells). The strategy for efficiently conducting large numbers of dose response follow-ups was to serial dilute all compounds in a plate to plate matrix rather than in a well to well matrix.  This then allows all 320 compounds in a source plate to be diluted together resulting is a 10 point dose response dilution series.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause an increase in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07  1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,653 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 219 potential small molecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 764). In the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and determine potency.   Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Test compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. Beads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt, Rac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine different concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data points. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand concentrations, generating competition curves. Ligand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. In order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) - [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be statistically significant) - |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of LOGEC50) - |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE) - [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test compound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) - [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the compound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 - ||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|) In this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive compounds the activity score is 0.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to confirm the activity of test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to measure p97 ATPase inhibition" (PubChem AID 1481). This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 8 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay 2.5 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 um) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2.5 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM p97 protein. Next, 40 nL of test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration) or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 2.5 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 10 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 5 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 48 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and luminescence was measured by the ViewLux microplate reader.

Description:  To identify small molecules that mediate calcium signaling via GPR30, a fluorescence-based calcium assay using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening on the basis of structural similarity to a compound identified in previous competition binding assays using GPR30 (SID 48409542). This assay was also employed as a counter-screen for compounds identified in competition binding assays with ERalpha and ERbeta to assess ligand selectivity. HL-60 cells (ATCC #CCL-240) expressing endogenous GPR30 were grown in RPMI media containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. Forty-eight hours prior to assay, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were harvested and resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI at a density of 1x10^7 cells / milliL. Cells were loaded 3 microM Indo-1AM (Invitrogen) in DMSO containing 0.05% pleuronic-F127 and nutated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and resuspended at a final concentration of 1x10^5 cells / microL and incubated on ice for 20 minutes prior to assay. The assay was conducted in a Photon Technology International fluorimeter equipped with two PMTs. Cells loaded with Indo-1AM were excited with 350nm light and emission was collected at 405nm and 490nm. Cuvettes were constantly stirred during data acquisition and maintained at 37 degreesC for the duration of the assay. Each 1 centiM square cuvette was loaded with 20 microL cells (2x10^6 cells) and 980 microL warm Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (pH 6.7) containing 20 milliM HEPES, 1 milliM calcium and 1 milliM magnesium. Cuvettes were incubated in the instrument for 90 seconds prior to data acquisition. Unknown compounds were injected in real time via a sample port at time = 20 seconds to determine agonist activity of the unknown compound. A concentration of estrogen known to induce a sub-maximal calcium flux signal was injected into the cuvette 90 seconds following addition of unknown compound to determine if the compound being screened antagonized estrogen-mediated calcium signaling. Concentration of test compound was 10 microM. The AGONIST_RESPONSE was determined based on the ability of the compounds to mobilize calcium or to prevent calcium mobilization in response to a known agonist. Based on estrogen mediated calcium mobilization = 100%, scores were assigned as follows for compounds with agonist activity: 0 = No calcium mobilization or low mobilization (0-50%) 50 = Moderate calcium mobilization, 50% - 100% 100 = High calcium mobilization, 100% or more Compounds with antagonist activity were assigned scores based on their ability to inhibit calcium mobilization (shown in column entitled ANTAGONIST_RESPONSE), with estrogen control defined as 0% inhibition: 0 = No inhibition of calcium mobilization or low inhibition (0-30%) 50 = Moderate calcium inhibion, 30 # 60% 100 = High calcium inhibition, 60% or more PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the maximum value of either AGONIST_RESPONSE or ANTAGONIST_RESPONSE. In column PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT the type of response observed was noted. Compounds were classified as "Actives" when PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "2".  "Non-active" compounds were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "1". A number of compounds were designated as fluorescent compounds and given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "3". The criteria used for this designation was based on the fluorescence of compound in testing cuvette being greater than observed with triton addition (i.e., greatest calcium mobilization).

Description:  Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  This high-content imaging assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55 " (AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. The assay will identify small molecule agonists of the GPR35 receptor.  This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further into coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 5) Positive Control Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis #ALX-430-020-M010,10mg) 5mM stock in DMSO diluted to 100uM in PBS. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1. Zaprinast (positive control) final concentration was 10uM.  c. Negative control was added to column 2.  Final DMSO concentration was 0.31% d.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted pyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to be crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications included functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the 3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to the fully unsaturated pyrazole. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kd#s are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian clock by using a chemical biology approach, we analyzed the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC, Sigma) on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. We utilized the circadian luciferase reporter Bmal1-dLuc for monitoring circadian rhythms in cultured human cells and developed a 384-well plate-based assay system to screen compound libraries. Among the 1,280 compounds tested, we identified 11 compounds causing reproducible period changes. Many of them are previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consistently caused a strong short period phenotype. This work was done in collaboration with Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and The Scripps Research Institute. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably expressing Bmal1-dLuc reporter were suspended in the culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.29 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin) and plated onto 384-well white solid-bottom plates (Greiner) at 20 ul (2,000 cells) per well. They were cultured for 2 days to reach confluence. Then, 50 ul of the explant medium [DMEM supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.38 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 0.29 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, and 1 mM luciferin (Promega)] was dispensed to each well, followed by the application of 500 nl of compounds (arrayed on 384-well plates at 1 mM in DMSO) by using 384-well head PinTool (GNF Systems). The plate was covered by an optically clear film (USA Scientific) and set to a GNF automated robotic system (GNF Systems) equipped with a CCD imager (ViewLux, Perkin Elmer) for luminescence recording. The settings are as follows: incubator temperature, 37C; exposure time, 120 sec; interval time, 120 min. Raw luminescence data were fit to a damped cosine curve using nonlinear least squares with CellulaRhythm algorithm, and period parameter was calculated. Each period data was normalized by subtracting the mean period of DMSO control (included in each plate) and indicated in columns Exp1_Period and Exp2_Period. Positive value means long period, and negative value means short period. The quality of the curve fitting was inspected manually, and the data with poor fitting were filtered out (indicated by blank in columns Exp1_Period and Exp2_Period). The screening was repeated twice (Exp1 and Exp2), and 13 compounds causing more than 0.5-h period change in both experiments were labeled as active. The 13 primary hits were tested in confirmation assay with 8-point dilution series, and the effects of 11 compounds were confirmed.

Description:  The focus of this screening campaign was to identify highly selective small molecules that act as allosteric agonists of the M4 muscarinic receptor. The assay utilized thallium influx through G-protein Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels as a measure of M4 activation. Compounds were tested at 10uM final concentration against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing cDNAs for GIRK 1, GIRK 2, and the M4 muscarinic receptor. The Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 plate reader was used to collect kinetic fluorescence intensities during treatment with the test compound. The muscarinic agonist carbachol was the positive control, and DMSO, the compound vehicle, was used as the negative control. M4/GIRK expressing HEK293 cells were plated at 15,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 20mM HEPES. 384-well, black walled, clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated plates were used. After overnight incubation at 37degreesC in the presence of 5% CO2, the medium was removed and BTC-AM (Molecular Probes) dye in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)) was added. After 1hour, the dye was replaced with HBSS. Test compounds were prepared in thallium assay buffer (125mM sodium gluconate, 1mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8mM calcium gluconate, 5mM glucose, 12mM thallium sulfate, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.3). The compounds were added to the cell plate by the Hamamatsu FDSS. Each cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 10seconds, 10uL of test compound was added, and the cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 2minutes total sampling time. Each kinetic trace was normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity to correct for dye loading of the cells. The ratios were used to calculate the slope of the response after compound addition (time 15 to 24 seconds). Slope values used resulted from a linear fit with 30 iterations or with a chi squared value less than or equal to 0.0001. The slope for each test compound response was compared to the vehicle control sample, DMSO. Compounds selected as 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100' had slope values greater than the 'Cutoff_Value' calculated as the mean of the vehicle control (DMSO) plus three times the standard deviations.

Description:  Yersinia pestis is the causal agent of the bubonic plague and, although modern antibiotics are extremely effective against the malady, the plague remains a threat in many areas in the world. Outbreaks of hundreds of cases still occur in Asia, Africa and South America and, in the United States cases are reported sporadically, mainly because of people handling infected animals or by being bitten by infected wild rodent fleas. YopH (Yersinia outer protein H) is a protein essential for the virulence of Yersinia. YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that antagonizes several signaling pathways including those associated with the phagocytosis of bacteria by host cells. Upon infection, YopH is translocated into the target cell, where it localizes to focal complexes. Several proteins have been identified as substrates for YopH including Cas, paxillin, SKAP-HOM, Fyb and Pyk. Because the phosphatase activity of the Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase, YopH, is essential for virulence in the Yersinia pathogen, potent and selective YopH inhibitors would be vital to understanding YopH signaling pathways (leading to virulence). The focus of the study presented here was to develop a novel high throughput screening assay that would allow for the identification of small molecules that interfere with YopH functionality.

Description:  Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by project collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30 nanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. This design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is associated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead sets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635 nanom. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7 might be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead control (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a fluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the test compounds. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of 218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds. RGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of the measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative control bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that particular protein is "inconclusive", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS Protein is "inconclusive", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant amounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702 compounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound (|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. RV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and RGS7, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library dependent "edge effect" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the data set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered "Active". Data from compounds located in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than 0 or greater than 135 were considered "Active". Active compounds include both activators - where %Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the 218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as potential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per protein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are RGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific. RGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel, which can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has the lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest bead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead set, the compound is flagged as "Potential Red Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as potential red fluorescent compounds. The Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library, average Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when excluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard deviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for target RGS16, due to the library dependent "edge effect", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68 standard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity of the protein. For easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the same compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an activator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column Ri_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where "i" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.

Description:  Injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity after the prolonged seizures termed status epilepticus (SE). Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) activation by ischemia and SE generally contributes to neuronal injury, but multiple downstream COX2 signaling pathways, and our data, suggest that the mechanisms promoting and opposing brain injury are complex. Cell culture medium:  500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen Strept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml  Geneticin Procedure: 1. Grow cells: Cells were grown over a week in T-175 flasks and split when appropriate to reach the final volume of 40-50 T-175 flasks necessary for screening. 2. Harvest cells: 1. Aspirate medium from T-175 flasks, rinse with HBSS without Ca-Mg. 2. Add 3 ml /flask Versene (EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml) (BioWhittaker Cat# 17-711E) 3. Tap flasks vigorously 4.

FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate. Normalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET blank(compound added)) / ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (no compound added)) % of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from control wells) * 100 % of inhibition = 100 - % of activity Where FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an average FRET ratio from wells with cells, Anti-cAMP-Eu and HBSS buffer only; FRET control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing 0.3 nM PGE2 that defines maximum FRET signal. Percent induction is then calculated based on a comparison with wells containing 1 uM PGE2: % induction = (Pct Inhibition Compound / Pct Inhibition 1 uM PGE2) * 100 Actives are compounds that are positive (>50% induction of cAMP) in assay 1 but negative (<30% induction of cAMP signal) in assays 2-5. Compounds found to be active are assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, those found to be inactive are assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTVIITY_SCORE of 0.

Description:  Inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct.  This cell line is deficient in STAT1. In this primary assay 194,700 test compounds from the MLSCN library were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Cells were exposed to test compounds from the MLSCN library, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 antagonist will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence.

Description:  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein SMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2 which are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips exon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2 protein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1 locus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form, it is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy that either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has been proposed for the treatment of SMA. We have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional SMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that inclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus generating functional luciferase enzyme. This screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter and splicing based cassettes in tandem with the major portion of the native SMN2 cDNA, and then transfected into HEK293 cells. Compounds that increase luciferase signal presumably enhance expression of the functional SMN2 splice variant. Passaging media contained DMEM w/ glutamax (+phenol red) 10% FCS, 1x pen/strep, 200 ug/ml hygro, 1x sodium pyruvate.

Description:  Human plasma factor XIa was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Cat # HFXIa 1111a). Substrate Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1575.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% Tween 20. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Factor XIa (0.23 ug/mL) was incubated with Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 2 hr at room temperature. Hits from mixture HTS were confirmed on single compounds by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.46 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1.  The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  The primary high throughput screening (HTS) assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPRL1. The FPR primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately (AID 440) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report.  Likewise, FPRL1 binding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and specificity of compounds identified to have FPR binding activity in the FPR primary HTS assay report (AID 440). For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).   fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide.  The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  Human lipoxygenase 15hLO-1 is a member of the closely related lipoxygenase family of enzymes which catalyze the site-specific oxidation of arachidonic acid to various hormone precursor molecules and as such is a candidate for drug development in a variety of disease areas, such as cancer and inflammation. Inhibition of 15hLO-1 activity was screened by utilizing arachidonic acid as a substrate. The extent of hydroperoxide product formation was measured by a secondary chromogenic reaction in which xylenol orange (XO, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. number 39,818-7) reacts with the ferric ions produced from the reaction between the hydroperoxide and ferrous ions. The Fe(III)-XO complex is characterized with red-shifted absorbance at 560 nm. A purified preparation of human 15hLO-1 was supplied by Professor Ted Holman, University of California, Santa Cruz. Assay Protocol: Buffer:  25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.01% Triton X-100. Reagents/Controls: Buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (no enzyme). Substrate solution: 50 uM arachidonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) final concentration dispensed throughout the plate. Enzyme: 40 nM 15hLO-1 final concentration in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Column 1 is neutral (100% activity). Column 2 contained pin-transferred titration of NDGA (nordihidroguaiaretic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, N 5023, top concentration 10 mM in DMSO, then 1:2 dilution in duplicate). (Dilution factor: 23 nL into 4 uL.) Chromogenic detection reagent (divalent iron/xylenol orange, Fe-XO): 200 uM xylenol orange plus 300 uM ferrous ammonium sulfate prepared freshly in 50 mM sulfuric acid. Assay Steps: Three uL of enzyme were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black clear bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 uL of substrate solution was added to start the reaction. After room temperature incubation for 6 minutes, 4 uL of  Fe-XO solution was added to each well followed by a short spin (1000 rpm, 15 sec) and the plates were then incubated for 30 min. The absorbance at 405 and 573 nm were measured using ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager and absorbance protocol settings. The 573-to-405 absorbance ratio was used to compute reaction progress.

Description:  The high-throughput screen for cathepsin G inhibitors reported here consisted of an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled tetrapeptide. The MLSCN compound library was screened as mixtures of 10 compounds per well and active compounds were confirmed by single compound IC50 determination. This assay was submitted to the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN) as X01 application MH076406-01.      Plates were also pooled 'vertically': Plates 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91 pooled to mixture plate 1-91 Plates 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92 pooled to mixture plate 2-92 And so on until mixture plate 10-100. For example, the single compound in well A3 in Plate 1 is mixed with 9 compounds in well A3 in mixture plate 1-10, and also with 9 different compounds in well A3 in mixture plate 1-91. The concentration of each mixture was 2.5 mM in DMSO (250 uM per compound). Pintool transfer into the HTS assay gave a final mixture concentration of 50 uM in 2% DMSO (5 uM per compound). Materials Human neutrophil cathepsin G was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219373). Substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1465.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 M sodium chloride. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Assay Cathepsin G (4.2 ug/mL) was incubated with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 3 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 50 uM compound mixture (5 uM each of 10 compounds).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the HUV-EC-C cell line which is derived from normal human vascular endothelial cells. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the HUV-EC-C cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-003) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The relaxin hormone is involved in the variety of biological functions in normal tissues and diseases. The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary gland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin signaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through regulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis. Significantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung fibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human relaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive heart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic sclerosis. Upon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. cAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP increase is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation.  To screen for agonists of the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit. This is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP1 receptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were lysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell lysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to a decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer only) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin). The EC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation 1536-well assay protocol for the HEK293 RXFP1 cAMP assay: (1) Add 3 ul  HEK293 RXFP1 cell culture. 2000 cells/well in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (dispensed offline with MultiDrop Combi). (2) Incubate 16-24 hr at 37C, 5% CO2. (3) Add 1 ul 400uM Ro20174 in DPBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.005% Tween 20. (3) Add 23 nl compounds in DMSO solution. Final concentration was 0.5 - 58 uM. (4) Incubate 30 min at 37C, 5% CO2. (5) Add 1 ul cAMP-d2 in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (6) Add 1 ul anti-cAMP antibody-cryptate in lysis buffer (HTRF cAMP HiRange kit, CisBio). (7) Incubate 30 min at room temperature. (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=320 nm, Em1=615 nm and Em2=665 nm.

Description:  In this assay STAT3 activation was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 activator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus enhancing the activity of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into all wells. The plates were then incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Signaling through the dopamine D1 receptor is coupled to the CRE/luciferase reporter system in HEK 293 cells. Compounds at 10 micromolar final concentration were tested in duplicate for their ability to modulate an EC30 concentration of isoproterenol. The signal readout from this assay is luciferase luminescence as measured by the Perkin Elmer Envision. 1. Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEKs) containing human D1 receptor were seeded at 35000 cells/well in Greiner black, solid bottom poly-lysine coated 384-well plates (Cat#781947) in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 5% Fetalclone I serum (Hyclone), 5% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 0.05 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). After incubation, the cell plates were cooled to room temperature for 15 minutes and 20 microliters of SteadyLite Luciferase Reagent (Perkin Elmer #6016989) was added.
