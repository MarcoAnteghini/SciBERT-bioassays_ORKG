Description:  The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2).  STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, the seven STAT family member (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Studies show that STAT3 is activated in a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1, 4, 6). Blocking STAT3 interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers has been shown to reduce tumor growth (7).  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective potentiators of STAT3 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932). In this assay activation of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3-luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 potentiator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus enhancing the activity of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. The STAT3 potentiator and antagonist confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 28 nL of nifuroxazide (100 uM final concentration in DMSO) were added to a subset of control wells, to monitor that the assay was functioning properly.  Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal concentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R), in triplicate. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 2797), are nonselective OXTR agonists due to activation of the related GPCR, vasopressin receptor 1 (V1). In this counterscreen assay a stable CHO cell line transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin. The average percent activation and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen (AID 2797) was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-4, and for inactive compounds 4-0.

Description:  The concept of biased agonism [1] is an emerging concept of molecular pharmacology which proposes that seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), exist in multiple signaling conformations and complexes and that ligands (either agonists or antagonists) can induce signaling biased responses for distinct signal transduction cascades. Recently, this concept has been highlighted by beta-arrestin-biased signaling through 7TMRs [1]. beta-arrestins have been known to interact with agonist-occupied 7TMRs and thus to sterically inhibit coupling of the receptor to G proteins, leading to termination of signaling. Furthermore, accumulating evidence over the last decade has drawn attention to a novel function of beta-arrestins as signal transducers that scaffold various signaling molecules upon activation of 7TMRs. In particular, beta-arrestins have been shown to mediate activation of several signaling pathways upon stimulation of 7TM receptors even in the absence of G protein activation [2]. This beta-arrestin-biased signaling presumably leads to distinct physiological outcomes from those by G protein activation. Additionally, the active receptor conformations which prefer on this beta-arrestin signaling are likely different from those activating G protein signaling One of the systems in which biased agonism has been thoroughly elucidated is beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs), where the 'antagonist' ligand carvedilol has been demonstrated to selectively activate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways [3]. The goal of this screening project will be to discover and optimize novel beta-arrestin-biased ligands for beta2-AR signaling. A luminescent cell-based assay for beta2-AR-mediated agonism, known as the Tango assay [4], has been validated in which ligand binding of a recombinant beta2-AR and subsequent recruitment of a recombinant beta-arrestin lead to the release of the transcriptional activator tTA, which upregulates transcription of a tTA-responsive luciferase gene.  Compounds with beta2-AR agonist activity lead to an increase in luciferase expression, and upon addition of a luciferase detection reagent, demonstrate an increase in luminescence.  Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 46 microM to 0.6 nM. Tango cells were dispensed into white, solid, tissue-culture-treated 1536-well plates at 1500 cells/well in DMEM, containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool.  Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 for 18 hr. Then 2.5 uL luminescent substrate mix (in-house prepared: 150 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM CoA, 0.15 mM ATP, 0.44 mM D-luciferin, final concentrations) was added to each well.  Plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and subsequently measured on a ViewLux plate reader for luminescent signal using a clear filter with a 10 second exposure and 2x binning. The %Activity was determined from the corrected luminescence values. Isoproterenol, a well-characterized beta2-AR full agonist, and metaproterenol, a less potent beta2-AR agonist, were included both in 16-pt titration and at full response concentration to normalize %Activity of identified agonists; DMSO-pinned controls were used to normalize 0%Activity (zero agonism), while EC100 isoproterenol and/or EC100 metaproterenol were used to normalize 100%Activity (full agonism). Concentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the resulting luminescence. The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity, and compounds were subsequently categorized based on their curve class. Active agonists showed concentration-dependent increases in luminescence, concordant with an increase in bound beta2-AR and luciferase expression. Inactive compounds showed no effect on luminescence signal.

Description:  To screen for small molecules that inhibit the 14-3-3 zeta/Bad interaction, a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR -FRET) based HTS assay was developed.  This homogenous assay has been miniaturized and optimized for ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) in a 1536-well format.  HexaHis-tagged 14-3-3 zeta protein is indirectly labeled with a europium chelate through a europium conjugated anti-6xHis antibody. Bad peptide phosphorylated at S136 was directly labeled with Dy647.  Europium and Dy647 comprise a fluorescence energy transfer pair. Interaction of 14-3-3 zeta protein and pS136-Bad peptide brings the two fluorophores into proximity, leading to an energy transfer from europium to Dy647 and the generation of FRET signal. The FRET signal is detected in an Envision plate reader (Ex 340 nM, Em 615 nM, and Em665 nM) and expressed as FRET signal ratio (F665nm / F615nm * 104).  The assay is robust with a consistent Z' factor of 0.6-0.9 in a 1536-well plate format and is used for the screening. 1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. Recombinant hexaHis-tagged 14-3-3 zeta protein 3. Dy647-pS136-Bad peptide: synthesized at Emory University 4. Europium Chelate Anti-6xHis-Antibody: LANCE Eu-W1024 (His-Eu) from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. Procedure: 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant 6xHis-14-3-3 zeta protein (10 nM, final concentration), Dy647-pS136-Bad peptide (20 nM, final concentration) and anti-6xHis-Eu antibody (1 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 4.5 uL of assay reaction buffer to 1536-well black assay plate (Costar 3724). 3. Add 0.1 uL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 1 hr. Final concentration of each compound in each well is 21.7 uM. 4. Record FRET signal with an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). An excitation filter at 340 nm and emission filters at 615 nm and 665 nm are used with a LANCE/DELFIA Dual mirror. 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 104 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate. Normalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (compound added)) / ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (no compound added)) % of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from control wells) * 100 % of inhibition = 100 - % of activity Where FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an average FRET ratio from wells with His-Eu and Dy647-pBad peptide only; FRET control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing His-14-3-3 zeta, His-Eu and Dy647-pBad peptide that defines maximum FRET signal. 3. Compounds that cause > 70% inhibition are defined as active.  The PubChem Activity Score is calculated by rounding the Pct Inhibition to 0 decimal places. Negative scores are changed to 0, and scores higher than 100 are changed to 100.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-009) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell line creation and culture of the human mGluR4/ Gqi5/CHO line. Human mGluR4 (hmGluR4)/CHO cells were stably transfected with the chimeric G protein Gqi5 in pIRESneo3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and single neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened for mGluR4-mediated calcium mobilization using the method described below. hmGluR4/CHO cells were cultured in 90% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 ug/ml proline, 2 mM glutamine, 400 ug/ml G418 sufate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 5 nM methotrexate (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise noted. Potency determinations. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Human mGluR4/Gqi5/CHO cells (30,000 cells/20 ul/well) were plated in black-walled, clear-bottomed, TC treated, 384 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, North Carolina) in DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Plating Medium). The cells were grown overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5% CO2.  The next day, the medium was removed and replaced using a Thermo Fisher Combi (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) with 20 uL of 1 uM Fluo-4, AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prepared as a 2.3 mM stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 10% (w/v) pluronic acid F-127 and diluted in Assay Buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)) for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compounds were transferred to daughter plates using an Echo acoustic plate reformatter (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) and then diluted into Assay Buffer to generate a 2x stock. Ca2+ flux was measured using the Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS6000, Hamamatsu, Japan). Baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm, emission, 540+/-30 nm) and then 20 ul/well test compounds were added using the FDSS's integrated pipettor. For concentration-response curve experiments, compounds were serially diluted 1:3 into 10 point concentration response curves in DMSO and were transferred to daughter plates using the Echo. 20 ul of test compounds (2X concentration) were applied and followed 2.5 minutes later by an EC20 concentration of glutamate (10 ul of a 5x final concentration). An EC80 concentration of glutamate was added 2 minutes later (12 ul of a 5x final concentration). Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For compounds where an EC50 was determined, the 'Activity' was assigned as 'Active' and the 'Score' was assigned as '100'. All other compounds were considered 'Inactive' and assigned a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  The present assay was undertaken to identify test compounds that acted as FPRL1 antagonists. Tested were 7 compounds that exhibited an inhibition constant (Ki) of less than 10 microM in at least one FPRL1 ligand-binding dose response experiment. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent the rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPRL1 peptide agonist, WKYMVm (WPep). The assay was performed in low throughput mode in a flow cytometer. Calcium response experiments were done as previously described with minor modifications.  RBL cells expressing FPRL1 were resuspended in warm tissue culture medium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 200 nanoM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After incubation, Fluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB medium (110 milliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) human serum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, and stored on ice. To assess the ability of test compounds to block FPRL1-induced intracellular calcium responses, Fluo4-loaded cells (1 x 10^6/milliL in 100 microL) were first incubated with or without the compound for 8 minutes at 37 degrees C (final concentrations of 0 or 100 microM test compound, 1% v/v DMSO). Cells were next analyzed for 20 seconds in a FACScanTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to establish a baseline for Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Finally, a 100 microL volume of HHB containing 0 or 1 nanoM of Wpep peptide was manually added and the analysis was reinitiated for an additional 80 seconds. For the duration of data collection the cell suspension was maintained at 37 degrees C and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirbar. Fluo4 fluorescence was excited at 488 nM and its emission intensity analyzed at 530 nm. The median Fluo4 fluorescence intensity MFI was determined at 0.6 second intervals, ~500 cells in each interval, throughout the analysis.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS and either 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Cys (Aldrich cat# 861677), or 10mM DTT and 50 units/well catalase (from bovine liver, Sigma cat#100)) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862) were nonselective due to inhibition of STAT1. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). In this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated induction of STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit STAT1 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final nominal IC100 concentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  We have identified small molecule inhibitors of BAP1 using a kinetic, fluorescence intensity high-throughput screen.  In this assay, ubiquitin conjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC) is used as a BAP1 substrate.  Hydrolysis of UbAMC by BAP1 results in the release of free AMC and an increase in fluorescence.  The reaction velocity is measured as the increase in fluorescence over time and is proportional to BAP1 activity.  Compounds identified in the initial single-dose screen have been confirmed in dose response using the same assay format.  To date, UbAMC is the only substrate commercially available for in vitro DUB activity assays.  However, the excitation/emission wavelengths of AMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm) overlap with those of many small molecules, which leads to a high percentage of fluorescence artifacts.  To overcome the problem of interference by compound autofluorescence, we replaced UbAMC with ubiquitin-rhodamine(110)-glycine (UbRHO).  The excitiation/emission wavelegths of RHO (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm) are right-shifted compared to those of AMC and has less overlap with autofluorescent compounds. RHO also generates a much stronger fluorescent signal, which greatly increases assay sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio, and allows for the use of less substrate. In this assay, compounds were tested side by side in dose response in both UbAMC and UbRHO assays. Many compounds that exhibited autofluorescence in the UbAMC assay did not in the UbRHO assay.  Resyntheses and analogs of MLSMR hits identified in the primary screen (AID 436) were tested in this assay.  Each compound was tested at 8 concentrations, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 uM. Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  Of 35 compounds tested in the UbAMC assay, 27 were repeated in the UbRHO assay.  1. Dilute BAP1, Ub-AMC, and UbRHO (provided by assay PI) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT). Keep on ice. 2. Add 25 ul of BAP1 (5 nM final) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls. 3. Transfer 1 uL compounds to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations. 4. Add 25 ul of 800 nM Ub-AMC (400 nM final) or 100 nM UbRHO (50 nM final). 5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using kinetic settings.  The plate was read every 1 minute 45 seconds for 10 readings.  6.  All compounds were tested in triplicate A 400 nm dichroic mirror was used for UbAMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm), and a 505 nm dichroic mirror was used for UbRHO (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm).

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR.  The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. The primary HTS FPRL1 counter-screen assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPRL1.  The FPR primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately.  The results of the present report represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in the primary HTS assay report. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well).  After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).   fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide.  The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. Test compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as: %Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)] in which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells containing test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of cells in negative control wells, respectively.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932), were nonselective due to activation of STAT3. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871). In this assay activation of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3-luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. An activator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus enhancing the activity of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that increase STAT3 activity are considered non-selective activators. The activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 28 nL of nifuroxazide (100 uM final concentration in DMSO) were added to a subset of control wells, to monitor that the assay was functioning properly. Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal concentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells. The plates were then incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule regulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. In the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets were characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of fluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the presence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control. Each protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery. Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation; kMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept where MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads. The resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation; kMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP) where ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.

Description:        To identify novel compounds that act as effective ER-alpha coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay has been developed in a 384 well format.  This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with the LBD of ER-alpha, which is induced in the presence of an agonist like estradiol, brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.  Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 629 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha Coactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was tested in 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar.  Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 434963). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Next, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value > 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-70, and for inactive compounds 51-0.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a well.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RasWT there are only 63 missing compounds. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be 'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0). Assessment of fluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the proteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are calculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this difference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT; CompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL with RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control fluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL from the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are calculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very similar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential fluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RasWT there are only 4,084 fluorescent compounds. Due to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound. Whole plate trends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression.  Then due to the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (notated with WPcalc) is utilized for calculating

Description:  Compound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. We describe a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign that was designed to measure the metabolic activity of a suspension cell line after challenge & 48 hours of incubation with test compound. For this primary HTS campaign the human T-cell line, Jurkat clone E6.1, was screened against the NIH set of 59,808 diverse compounds. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration. A luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for this assay. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is not present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no luminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates with the presence of inviable cells. This campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive control. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately 100 nM. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. A suspension of Jurkat cells (clone E6.1; ATCC Cat# TIB-152, Invitrogen Cat# K1045) in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, 5mM L Glutamine, and 1x antibiotic was prepared prior to assay. The concentration of cells in the suspension was 1 million/milliliter. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Then 20nL of test compound or control doxorubicin was added. Plates were lidded and incubated at 37 deg C at 5% CO2 for 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5 microliters / well of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Corp., Madison Wisconsin). After ten minutes of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the Viewlux Imaging UHTS reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median of the positive control doxorubicin at 4 micromolar final screening concentration.

Description:  Pyruvate kinase (L. Mexicana) (LmPK) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) sulphate-free preparation from University of Edinburgh, UK and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of enzyme mix (kept on ice) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) containing PEP (0.5 mM final concentration) and LmPK (0.1 nM final concentration) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of ADP mix in assay buffer (r.t; 0.1 mM final ADP concentration) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme). To monitor activation, the first column contained a five-fold concentration of LmPK (0.5 nM).

Description:  The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine kinase involved in growth factor and integrin mediated signal transduction pathways As with the primary and confirmation screens, a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) method to monitor the phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate by FAK was used to screen for inhibitors. The principle of the assay is similar to other kinase detection systems utilizing TR-FRET, except this method utilizes a FRET acceptor dye which is coupled directly to the substrate. The level of substrate phosphorylation by FAK activity is detected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-peptide antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate bring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur. A potential inhibitor of FAK would prevent the proper phosphorylation of the substrate, decreasing the FRET signal. Assay preparation was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters per well of a solution containing 2 nM FAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) into a black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. Next, 35 nL of test compound from the MLSCN library (final nominal concentration of 7 micromolar, 0.7% final DMSO concentration) or positive and negative control (143 micromolar staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 10 micromolar ATP in kinase buffer. After 60 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 5 microliters of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature.  After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer).   To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound = Wells containing test compound LowControl = Wells containing DMSO HighControl = Wells containing 1 micromolar staurosporine (corresponding to staurosporine#s IC100). For each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from archaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances of transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can restore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when polyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated expression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity phenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin, tau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in the appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to the proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of alternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates. A role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that the heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting a role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct relationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock proteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues of affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of Hsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High throughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat shock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and may lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders. The purpose of this assay is to determine the cytotoxicity of test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1203) and confirmed activity via dose-response assays entitled, "Dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1252).  The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP found in viable cells.  Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. Thus, well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability.  As designed, compounds that induce cell death will reduce ATP levels, and therefore reduce well luminescence.  Compounds were assayed in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 99 uM.  Compounds active in the assays above and inactive in this cytotoxicity counterscreen are considered nontoxic inducers of Hsp70 transcription.

Description:  Fluorescence-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in s set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)" (AID 1800). In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide molecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5' fluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to a second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon strand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon strand forms an intramolecular hairpin that brings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules into juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity at 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin formation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and quencher, thus preventing quenching of well fluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also performed to identify compounds that quench and enhance Cy5 fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 10.9 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM Tween20, 6 micrograms/mL BSA) containing 13.89 nM NS3 helicase fragment and 5.56 nM NS3 substrate were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, thioflavine S (110 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of 5 mM ATP into all wells. Well fluorescence was read after 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to inhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60 (RFU_t60), named Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows: Ratio_RFU = RFU_t60 / RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-16, for inactive 16-0.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases The assay described here is a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases are simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library.  The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.   Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated.

Description:  Escherichia coli DnaK, a homolog of heat shock protein 70, has been shown to protect denature proteins from aggregation and promote their refolding by ATP hydrolysis. DnaK, along with its two co-cohort proteins DnaJ and GrpE, forms a microbial chaperone system that shelters microorganisms from environmental stresses such as temperature, osmotic, and pH changes, carbon and/or nitrogen starvation. Seeking inhibitors against bacterial DnaK chaperone systems will lead to a new direction for the development of antimicrobial agents, as current antimicrobial compounds have shown fewer efficacies due to the rapid emergence of resistant strains involving both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. An in vitro refolding assay was developed by Chaperone Technologies to detect and quantify the activity of DnaK. Firefly luciferase was chemically denatured and used as a substrate for the chaperone system. Luminescence readout was then used to detect the refolding of luciferase enzyme. The Emory Center has optimized and adapted the assay to a 384-well format for HTS and was able to consistently achieve a signal to noise ratio of above 8 and a Z prime factor of above 0.5. Positive compounds from the screening assay, AID 547, were chosen for follow-up in this dose-response screen. Escherichia coli DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE proteins were purchased commercially through Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, Michigan), Luciferase enzyme was from Sigma. Promega's Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System was used for the luminescence detection. The assay was carried out in three steps: chemical denaturation of firefly luciferase, chaperone induced refolding, and detection of luciferase levels. 23 uM of firefly luciferase stock in glycine buffer (1 M glycine, 0.1 M of MgSO4, 0.01 M of EDTA, pH7) was denatured in denaturing buffer containing 6 M guanidinium HCl, 30 mM Tris HCl, and 5 mM DTT at pH7.5 for 30min at room temperature and 60 min at 5 degrees C. Denatured luciferase was then diluted to working concentration (20 nM) with cold refolding buffer plus (10 mM MOPS, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 1 mM ATP, pH7.5).  The sample was furthered incubated at 5 degrees C for at least 60 min before use. At the same time, chaperone protein mixture of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE was prepared in working concentrations of 200, 100 and 400 nM, respectively, in refolding buffer (10 mM MOPS, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5) and incubated for at least 3 hr at room temperature. HTS was carried out in white, opaque bottom, 384-well polystyrene plates (Costar) with 12.5 uL of denatured luciferase and 12.5 uL of chaperone protein mixture using Wellmate dispenser by Matrix Technologies. For each plate, columns 1, 2 and 23, 24 contain controls: denatured luciferase only, refolding buffer only, chaperone proteins only and CHP105 at 100 ug/mL as positive controls. Compounds (0.5 mM stock in DMSO) were then added in the appropriate concentration to assay plates using Caliper's Sciclone liquid handler. In order to rule out compound induced refolding, a separate set of plates with only denatured luciferase plus compounds were set up parallel with the assay. All plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 3 hr. The luciferase activity was measured by adding 25 uL of diluted Steady-Glo (18.75 uL of refolding buffer, 6.25uL of Steady-Glo) before reading with Perkin Elmer's Envision. All data were normalized to plate controls using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.

HTS hits were confirmed on single compounds by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.46 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Compounds that inhibit tumor cell growth may have cytotoxic or cytostatic effects and vary widely in structure and mechanism of action.  Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit tumor cell growth by disrupting cell division or other mechanisms, which often results in apoptotic cell death.  The ability of a compound to inhibit the growth of the human non-small cell lung tumor line, A549, is a preliminary indication of anticancer activity for treating patients with lung cancer.  In order to screen a structurally diverse library of compounds for tumor cell growth inhibitory activity, we implemented a high throughput screening assay to measure viable cell number.  Numerous classes of compounds may cause cytotoxicity by perturbing a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, interfering with mitosis, or disrupting various aspects of cell function, which will result in the reduction of viable cell number, which can be measured by a variety of endpoints such as metabolic activity and ATP levels. Cultured human A549 lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds from a 3317 compound library for 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM.  Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega).  The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminsence.  Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control and 32 replicates of cells treated with doxorubicin at 5 uM, which served as the positive control.  Average growth inhibition values were calculated based on two separate experiments.  Compounds showing an average percent growth inhibition value of 50% or greater were scored as active, while compounds which cause less than 50% growth inhibition were scored as inactive.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence dose response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): purchased compounds EC50. The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 agonist dose response from powder samples. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 ug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, 100 ug/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 6 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 22 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-90, for inactives 12-0.

Description:  Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) (AID 434989), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492963). Compounds tested in this assay were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonists: cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the parental CHO cell line, in triplicate" (AID 492965). In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX1R receptor (CHO/OX1R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the Fluo-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 49.8 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 739 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 - 575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC Challenge), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.8 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.8 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-80, and for inactive compounds 79-0.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), working with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), control the phosphorylation state of many proteins in the signal transduction pathways. HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. In this assay, activity of HePTP is evaluated in the absence of DTT normally present as part of the buffer during SAR studies (AID 1077). The catalytic reaction is initiated with substrate addition. Enzyme activity and its inhibition by test compounds is measured in a kinetic assay based on hydrolysis of 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) resulting in a fluorescence increase due to 3-O-methylfluorescein release. HePTP assay materials: HePTP assay materials: 1)HePTP protein was provided by Dr. Mustelin (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). 2)Assay Buffer: 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 375 mM NaCl, 0 mM DTT, 0.0125% Tween 20. 3) Upon pre-incubation for 10 min. in the presence of 25 mM DTT, 20 uM HePTP enzyme stock was aliquoted and flash-frozen. HePTP working solution at 3 nM in the assay buffer without DTT was prepared using this pre-incubated stock. 4) OMFP working solution: 600 uM OMFP in the assay buffer HePTP dose-response assay protocol: 1) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi dispense 10 ul of OMFP working solution into all columns of black small-volume Greiner plates (784076) 2) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi dispense 10 uL of assay buffer in columns 1-2. 3) Using LabCyte Echo 550 add 0.2 uL of serially diluted compounds to columns 3-22 and DMSO to columns 1-2 and 23-24. Final concentration of DMSO was 1 % 4) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi dispense 10 of HePTP working solution to wells in columns 3 through 24. 5) Incubate lidded plate for 1 hour at room temp. 6) Read plate on M5 plate reader in fluorescence mode (ex: 480nm; 3m: 520nm; dichroic mirror is 515 nm) 7)Data analysis and curve fitting was performed with CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc) by non-linear regression using 4 parameter binding model.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that were purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single particular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated against different GTPase targets. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP2C19 to measure the hydroxylation of ethylene glycol ester of 6' deoxyluciferin (Luciferin-H EGE; luciferin detection buffer) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection reagent. Luciferin-H EGE concentration in the assay was equal to its KM for CYP2C19. Inhibitors and some substrates limit the production of luciferin, and decrease measured luminescence. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 5nM CYP2C19, 10uM Luciferin-H EGE, 50mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at 37C for 10 min. Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at 37C. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted luciferin detection buffer. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents and further information can be found at http://www.promega.com/tbs/tb325/tb325.pdf. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (57uM ketoconazole).

Description:  This line contained the human 5-HT1E receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15), and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. When cells were agonized with a 5HT1E agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment 51 compounds were tested to determine individual EC50 values. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations. The highest test concentration was nominally 43 micromolar. The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The HTS assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added. The selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 was also added (43 nL) to positive control wells to a final concentration of one micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added to all wells. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, plate fluorescence was measured with the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm.  The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated for each well. Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: %Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)] For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1P2). A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used to measure S1P2 antagonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. In this assay, cells have been stimulated with the S1P agonist, which stimulates the S1P2 receptor, hence increasing BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by exogenously added S1P. Therefore, in the presence of a potential S1P2 antagonist, transcription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P2 antagonists will inhibit BLA transcription and cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 deg C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 microliter of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 750 nanomolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 microliter of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Human 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) catalyzes the inactivation of prostaglandin E2, and plays a major role in cancer biology by antagonizing the oncogenic potential of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2). Assays are available, based on absorbance/fluorescence increase of NADH with the substrate 15-OH prostaglandin E2. Inhibition of HPGD activity was screened by utilizing prostaglandin as an electron donor and NAD+ as an electron acceptor/cofactor. An increase in the fluorescence intensity due to conversion of NAD+ to NADH was used to measure the enzyme activity. Buffer:  50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8. Enzyme Buffer:  50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM NAD+ and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8. Reagents/Controls: Buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (no enzyme). Substrate/cofactor solution: 1 mM NAD+ and 30 uM prostaglandin (Sigma, prostaglandin E2, # P5640) final concentrations dispensed throughout the plate. Enzyme: 20 nM HPGD final concentration in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Column 1 and 2 is neutral (100% activity).  A titration of control inhibitor GW5074 (G6416 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) top concentration 10 mM in DMSO, then 1:2 dilution for a total of 16 concentrations in duplicate) was pin-transferred into column 2. Assay Steps: Three uL of enzyme were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid bottom plates. Compounds and control inhibitor (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 uL of substrate/cofactor solution was added to start the reaction. The plates were immediately transferred to and read 5 times every 30 seconds on ViewLux High-throughput CCD imager (Perkin-Elmer) using 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission fluorescence protocol. The fluorescence intensity difference between the last and the first time points was used to compute reaction progress.

Description:  This STAT3 potentiator assay was run simultaneously in the same plates as the STAT3 antagonist campaign (PubChem AID 862).  The cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).  Cells were harvested by trypsinization when they passed 70% confluency. Cells were resuspended in growth medium without phenol red, at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.5 micromolar final nominal concentration in DMSO) or DMSO (less than 0.6% final concentration) to sample or control wells, respectively.  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Then, 28nL of nifuroxazide (100 uM final concentration in DMSO) were added to a subset of control wells, to monitor that the assay was functioning properly.  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (final nominal concentration 33 ng/mL) was dispensed into sample wells.  This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80% STAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Next, the plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  Prior to % potentiation calculations, luminescence values were corrected by subtracting background luminescence, measured in wells containing media and substrate only.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. This assay is a follow-up to "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the APJ  receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2520. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect agonists that cause the activation the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

Description:  Luciferase assay (Steady-Glo, Promega). Primary screen using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably over-expressing a plasmid containing 3 copies of the Hypoxia Responsive Element  linked to luciferase gene (U2OS HRE-luciferase cells) to identify small molecules inducing an increased luciferase activity in these cells. The small molecules inducing expression of luciferase under HRE promoter will be measured by the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin and light (luminescence) mediated by the luciferase. Identification of probe(s) activating the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. More specifically, compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the signal obtained from the in-plate positive control (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background will be considered hits, though this threshold may be adjusted based on number of hits. U2OS HRE-luciferase assay: Summary of ELN assay protocols taken from Cbip ID runs: 2030-01-A01-04-01 to 2030-01-A01-11-04. The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line was originally obtained from Dr. Margaret Ashcroft's lab and kindly provided by Dr. Shawn Gilbert. The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line is propagated in DMEM media (Invitrogen, SKU11995) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016) and 0.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, 10687-01) at 37c in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening assays, cells are grown in T175 flask (BD Falcon, Ref 353112) or Hyperflasks (Corning, Cat 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using 7 or 75 ml Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (Cellgro, Cat. No. 25-053-CI) for 5 minutes and then the trypsin is inactivated with 7 or 75 ml of complete medium respectively. Cells should not be trypsinized more than 10 minutes because massive cell death will start to occur. Cells are centrifuged at 1000rpm/5min and resuspended in fresh complete DMEM media with phenol (Invitrogen, SKU11995) as mentioned above (for normal cell propagation) or DMEM medium without phenol (Cambrex; Cat. No 12-917F or Invitrogen; cat. no.31053) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016), sodium pyruvate (only used with DMEM without phenol from Invitrogen (cat 11306-070)) and without hygromycin B (for compound screening). Cell number is counted using a Nexelcom Bioscience cell counter (Cellometer(r) Auto M10) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS. Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform General system (GS) automation unit: Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  U2OS-HRE-luc cells are harvested and resuspended in DMEM without phenol (Cambrex, 12-917F) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen,10378-016) without hygromycin B. U2OS HRE-luciferase cells (from an initial cell suspension of 120,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, Cat.No. 8867BC) at a final density of 6,000 cells per well in final volume of 50 &#956;L. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing. 2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) and  incubated for 24 hours at 37C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (Model STX 220IC)(General automation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate): 3.The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators STX10001 and 2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 (Model STX 220HR) before the initiation of the pinning run. The In-plate positive control compound plate (sentinel)(100 &#956;M DFX (Desferrioxamine), Sigma-Aldrich D9533, BRD-K09821361-066-08-4), dose response plate (DFX) (12 different concentrations starting at 160 &#956;M and diluted 2 fold on each subsequent well) or vehicle (Base plate, DMSO) are already present in the Liconic incubator 8 at the beginning of the pinning. Both STX and Liconic 8 CO2 incubator temperature are kept at 20C. First, the base plate and the dose response plate are pinned once using 384 well pin tool (100 nl) on pin table (GS) and transferred to assay plate. Pins are washed with methanol and DMSO between each pinning. Second, the MLPCN test compounds plates are pinned as well as the in-plate positive control (32 wells, 100 &#956;M DFX) are pinned consecutively one after the other and transferred into one assay plate. Each compound plate is pinned twice in 2 different assay plates (duplicate). The final concentration for the MLPCN test compounds is 7.5&#956;M with final concentration no more than 1% DMSO. Finally, a second round of the base plate and the dose response plate pinning is achieved at the end of the run. 4.   After the pinning has occured, the In-plate positive control, dose response and base plates are returning into the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 and the MLPCN compounds plates are placed back into the STX1000 systems. The assay plates treated with compounds are moving back to Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to be incubated for an additional 24 hours. Day 3 (Reading luminescence from assay plates with Envision): 5.The assay plates are physically transferred from Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to Liconic CO2 incubator 7 (Model STX 220IC). Each assay plate is pulled out of the incubator and cooled down at room temperature for 30 minutes on Liconic Caroussel 1. 30 &#956;L/well (384 well) of Steady-Glo luciferase reagent 0.5X (diluted in H2O) (Promega, E2550) is dispensed using the the MultiDrop Combi/long tubing dispensing cassette from Thermo Scientific. The assay plate returned to Liconic Caroussel 1 for 30 minutes to allow a complete cellular lysis. 6.  Luminescence is measured (0.2 second/well) using the ultra sensitive luminescence detector (384-well aperture, 0.5 mm height) in each well using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting). 7.   HRE activation is calculated based on the following equation using mean luminescence (RLU) values: Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates  will be considered as active hits. Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in only one out of 2 assay plates will be considered inconclusives and the compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) lower than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates will be considered not actives.

Description:  The present assay was undertaken to identify test compounds that acted as FPR antagonists. Tested were 34 compounds that exhibited an inhibition constant (Ki) of less than 10 microM in at least one FPR ligand-binding dose response experiment. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent the rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPR peptide agonist, fMLFF. The assay was performed in low throughput mode in a flow cytometer. Calcium response experiments were done as previously described with minor modifications. U937 cells expressing FPR were resuspended in warm tissue culture medium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 200 nanoM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After incubation, Fluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB medium (110 milliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) human serum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, and stored on ice. To assess the ability of test compounds to block FPR-induced intracellular calcium responses, Fluo4-loaded cells (1 x 10^6/milliL in 100 microL) were first incubated with or without the compound for 8 minutes at 37 degrees C (final concentrations of 0 or 100 microM test compound, 1% v/v DMSO). Cells were next analyzed for 20 seconds in a FACScan(TM) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to establish a baseline for Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Finally, a 100 microL volume of HHB containing 0 or 1 nanoM of fMLFF peptide was manually added and the analysis was reinitiated for an additional 80 seconds. For the duration of data collection the cell suspension was maintained at 37 degrees C and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirbar. Fluo4 fluorescence was excited at 488 nM and its emission intensity analyzed at 530 nm. The median Fluo4 fluorescence intensity MFI was determined at 0.6 second intervals, ~500 cells in each interval, throughout the analysis. The MFI values were summed and averaged for the 20 seconds prior to stimulus addition (Avg_MFI_Base). The MFI values were summed over 114 measurements made during the last 70 seconds post-addition to determine the area under the response curve post-addition (AUC_Post). Avg_MFI_Base was multiplied by 114 to obtain a baseline area under the curve estimate (AUC_Base). The response to stimulus was calculated as the difference:

Description:  Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule antagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the chemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a role at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells, and dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a recent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal liver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in primary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the metastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation of the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases including hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as 'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important objective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer metastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. In this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. The goal of this assay is to validate hits obtained in "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 493098. A.

Description:  Human 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) catalyzes the inactivation of prostaglandin E2, and plays a major role in cancer biology by antagonizing the oncogenic potential of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2). Studies to assess the stability of human 15-PGDH in presence of compounds was performed as described with variations. HPGD was diluted to a final assay concentration of 1 uM in 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.01% Tween-20 and 1:1000 SYPRO orange dye. The final assay volume is 10 ul, with or without 200 uM of either NAD+ or NADH.  Compounds were added 1:5 from appropriate stock solutions in 10% (v/v) DMSO to comprise either 50 or 250 uM final concentrations. Heat denaturation curves were recorded using a RT-PCR instrument (Mx3005p, Agilent) applying a temperature gradient of 2 degree C/min. Analysis of the data was performed using DSF Analysis vers. 2.5 (ftp://ftp.sgc.ox.ac.uk/pub/biophysics) and Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.)

Description:  Primary cell based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2) A total of 3,750 neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences) in a 5uL volume per well were dispensed into a 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plate. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Two ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye was then dispensed into all wells. Plates were then incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement (plate read) was performed (510-545nm excitation and 565-625nm emission). Next, 25 nl of test compound (i.e. compound from the MLSCN compound library; final nominal concentration of 2.7 uM, 0.27% final DMSO concentration) or positive or negative control (1 uM BIIE0246 and DMSO, respectively) was then added to the appropriate wells. The cells were then challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of 4.5 uM isoproterenol and 500 nM NPY in 1x phosphate buffer saline containing 112.5 uM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (final concentration of 111nM NPY and 1 uM Isoproterenol). Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature before the final read using the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T30 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T30 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 30 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl)/(Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound= Well containing test compound and challenge LowControl: Wells containing DMSO and challenge HighControl: Wells containing 1 uM BIIE0246 in the presence of challenge. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), working with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), control the phosphorylation state of many proteins in the signal transduction pathways. HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. This colorimetric HTS assay was developed and run to identify HePTP inhibitors. HePTP assay materials: 1) HePTP protein was provided by Dr. Mustelin (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). The pNPP pellets were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (S0942). Biomol Green reagent was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc (AK-111) 2) Assay Buffer: 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.0125% Tween 20. 3) HePTP working solution contained 6.875 nM HePTP in assay buffer. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 4) pNPP working solution contained 1 mM pNPP in MQ water. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 5) Vanadate working solution - 45 mM Na3VO4 in 10% DMSO HePTP HTS protocol: 1) 4 uL of 100 uM compounds in 10% DMSO were dispensed in columns 3-24 of Greiner 384-well clear microtiter plates (781101). 2) 4 uL of the following solutions were using the Multidrop bulk dispenser (Thermo): a. 10% DMSO column 1 (negative control) b. 45 mM Na3VO4 in 10% DMSO - column 2 (positive control). 3) 8 uL of HePTP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 4) 8 uL of pNPP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 5) Final concentrations of the components in the assay were as follows: a. 20 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 1.0 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween 20. b. 2.75 nM HePTP (columns 1-24) c. 0.4 mM pNPP (columns 1-24) d. 9 mM Na3VO4 (column 2) e. 2 % DMSO (columns 1-24) f. 20 uM compounds (columns 3-24) 6) Plates were incubated for 1h at room temperature. 7) 40 uL of Biomol Green reagent was added to the entire plate using the WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 8) Plates were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature 9) Absorbance at 620 nM was measured on the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). 10) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). HePTP dose-response confirmation screening protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have RV less than 100. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. An active compound for RGS4 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 26 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This particular assay uses BJ cell line which is derived from normal human foreskin fibroblast. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the BJ cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and tamoxifen were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen, cat# PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates. Following the Clk4 reaction, the remaining ATP levels were detected using Promega Kinase-Glo technology wherein the remaining ATP from the kinase reaction is detected using Ultra-Glo luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the ATP. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 300801-52-9) which has been described as an inhibitor of Clk 4[1]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 25 mM Tris pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner, solid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Using a Kalypsys pin tool equipped with a 1536-pin tool, 23 nL of compound solution was transferred to the assay plate. One uL/ well Clk4-buffer solution (25 nM Clk4, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentrations) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 3 uL/ well. After 4.5 hours of room temperature incubation, 3 uL Kinase-Glo reagent was added for a final assay volume of 6 uL/ well. Luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) after 5 min incubation using a 5 second exposure time and 2x binning.

Description:  This screen is designed to identify inhibitors of PKA. The known PKA inhibitor Staurosporine was used as a positive control. Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary high-throughput assay for chemical inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) activity" (PubChem AID= 524) were selected for testing in this assay. Out of 94 compounds identified during the primary screen, all 94 compounds were assessed in dose response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 60 micromolar.As with the primary screen, this assay is based on ability of PKA kinase to phosphorylate a Kemptide peptide sequence. PKA uses ATP as a donor of phosphate for the phosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay kit (Kinase-Glo, Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Residual amounts of ATP are measured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, during which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to produce luminescence. In this assay, the luminescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of ATP and inversely proportional to PKA activity. Each concentration was tested nominally in triplicate. The dose response assay was conducted in 1536 well plate format.

The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 2797), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 434963), are nonselective OXTR agonists due to activation of the related GPCR, vasopressin receptor 1 (V1). This assay determines V1R agonism dose response curves for compounds. In this counterscreen assay a stable CHO cell line transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value > 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-94, and for inactive compounds 54-0.

Description:  Luciferase (Kinase-Glo, Promega Corporation) was assayed for its ability to generate light using ATP and luciferin as substrates. The ATP concentration in the assay (10 uM) was within the linear range of enzyme activity for the assay conditions used. Four uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 10 uM ATP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white 1536 well plates. Twenty-three nL of compound was delivered by a pin tool and 2 uL of luciferase detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega)) was added. Following 8-minute incubation at ambient temperature, luminescence was measured by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 seconds exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (40 uM SIB 1757) and curve fitting was performed using Hill equation.

Description:  Counterscreen panel assay for S1P4 antagonists: Ricerca HitProfilingScreen + CYP450. Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this panel of binding assays performed by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC, is to identify a subset of potential receptors, transporters, ion channels, etc. for which the S1P4 antagonist compound SID 87357351 displays affinity. Assays for CYP450, 1A2; CYP450, 2C19; CYP450, 2C9; CYP450, 2D6; and CYP450, 3A4 were enzyme assays using human recombinant insect Sf9 cells with 5 uM 3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin as substrate (except for CYP450, 3A4, which used 50 uM 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin as substrate). Detection was based on spectrofluorimetric quantitation of the enzymatic product produced. Assays for the other targets were radioligand binding assays. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The following applies to each panel in this assay: A response of >= 50% inhibition or stimulation is considered "active". Negative inhibition represents a stimulation of binding. List of Reagents: Reagents were provided by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC.

Description:  Pyruvate kinase (L. Mexicana) (LmPK) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) sulphate-free preparation from University of Edinburgh, UK and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of enzyme mix (kept on ice) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) containing PEP (0.5 mM final concentration) and LmPK (0.1 nM final concentration) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of ADP mix in assay buffer (r.t; 0.1 mM final ADP concentration) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme). To monitor activation, the first column contained a five-fold concentration of LmPK (0.5 nM).

Description:  Schistosoma mansoni, a causative agent of schistosomiasis, resides in the bloodstream of their host up to 30 years without being eliminated by the host immune attack. One proposed survival mechanism is the production of an antioxidant "firewall" that neutralizes the oxidative assault of the host's immune attack. Schistosoma mansoni peroxiredoxins (Prx) are important parasite antioxidant proteins that play a crucial role in redox balance mechanisms. Data strongly suggest the possible use of Prx as novel drug targets. First, the proteins are essential for the parasite survival. Second, the proteins exhibit sufficient biochemical and structural differences from host Prx proteins. Third, the protein(s) is amenable for study at the molecular level and can be produced in bacteria in large quantities, in soluble and active form. Inhibition of Prx activity was screened in a coupled-enzyme format with reducing equivalents being transferred from NADPH to glutathione intermediate via thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR)-catalyzed reaction, then from thioredoxin to hydrogen peroxide via Prx-catalyzed electron transfer. A decrease in the fluorescence intensity of NADPH was used to measure the enzyme activity. Purified S. mansoni TGR and Prx were provided by Professor David L. Williams, Illinois State University. Buffer:   100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20. Reagents / Controls:   100 uM NADPH in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (fully inhibited, zero % activity).   100 uM NADPH/25 nM TGR/700 uM GSH/50 nM Prx2 mixture in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Titration of control potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT, from 1 mM, then 1:5) pin-transferred to lower half of column 2. Column 1 and upper half of column 2 are neutral (100% activity).   Three uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black plates. Compounds and controls (20 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then a 1 uL aliquot of 400 uM NADPH/700 uM GSH was added, immediately followed by a 1uL aliquot of 2.5 mM H2O2 (to start the reaction). The plate was transferred to ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager where kinetic measurements (every 30 sec, for a total of 8 min) of NADPH fluorescence were taken using 365 nm excitation/450 nm emission filter set. During dispense, enzyme-containing reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath to minimize degradation.

Description:  Counterscreen for vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this cell-based assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 2797), and "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R)" (AID 434964), and that were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 434969), and "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435), are nonselective V1R agonists due to activation of the related GPCR, oxytocin receptor (OXTR; OTR). This assay determines OXTR (OTR) agonism dose response curves. In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.

Description:  West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito borne infectious agent that causes febrile illness and occasionally encephalitis.  Outbreaks had been reported in Africa, Asia, and Europe since 1937.  In 1999, the first case of WNV was detected in New York City from which time the virus spread rapidly west resulting in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever reported in the US. Currently, there is no vaccine for human use or antivirals that are available to treat WNV infections, leading to patient care which is mainly supportive. Hence this program will provide chemical probes from which to optimize leads for treatment of this emerging disease.  To screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format. The assay measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in Vero E6 cells by WNV infection using cell viability as the end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by WNV infection involves challenging 3,000 cells with WNV virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The WNV virus strain NY-99 stock was prepared from Vero E6 cells at the SRI BSL-3 facility. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 96 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. The percent cell viability was taken as an assessment of antiviral activity. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. Cell Culture: Vero E6 cells were cultured in Eagles modified MEM (E-MEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS and 100 U of penicillin, 100 ug of streptomycin per mL (culture media). The cells are maintained at 37C, 5.0% CO2 to 100% confluence being passaged every seven days. For cell plating, cells were detached from flask bottom by using Trypsin-EDTA solution and then re-suspended in a growth media WNV culture: WNV strain NY-99 was used for screening. The WNV stock was prepared in Vero E6 cells using an initial stock obtained from Dr. Heil. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were grown in two T-150 plates to 90% confluence. After the supernatant was removed from the culture, 2ml of WNV at 10E7 pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. Virus was adsorbed to cells for 2 hours at 37C and then the fresh culture media was replaced. After four days incubation, the supernatant was harvested and the cell debris pelleted by low speed centrifugation. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80C. These virus stocks were titrated in Vero E6 cells using agarose overlay plaque method and the titer was 8.3E7 pfu/ml. Control and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and 5 uL was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates. Test compounds were diluted in media to 60 uM with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%. 5 uL was also dispensed to the assay plate. The final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1% for the single dose screen and 0.5% for the dose response screen. Cell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 3,000 cells/well were plated in 15 uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37C, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity. Then the plates were transferred to a BSL-3 containment laboratory. Virus Addition: WNV stock was diluted in the culture media to 60,000 pfu/ml and 10 uL was added to the compound wells and the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.1 ~ 0.2). Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell control wells. All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-3 laboratory. The plates were incubated in an actively humidified incubator with 5.0% CO2 at 37C for 96 h. Endpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-3 facility. Compounds Screened: A single dose screen of the current full set of compounds from the MLSMR was performed at a concentration of 10 uM.  Compounds in the single dose assay were evaluated on the basis of % inhibition of the virus compared to cell only control.  The 601 most potent compounds were resupplied for a dose-response confirmatory assay. These compounds were tested in triplicate in a ten point stacked-plate dose response in concentrations diluted 1:2 beginning at 20 uM and ending at 0.039 uM.  Data Analysis: Thirty two control wells containing cells only  (Cell control) ,  twenty four wells containing cells and virus (Virus control) were included on each assay plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. And also eight wells containing cells, virus and control drug, Mycophenolic Acid at 5 uM were included on each assay plate. The average Z factor for the single dose campaign was 0.81. The percent inhibition of virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was calculated as: 100*(Cmpd Lum - Median Virus Ctrl)/(Median Cell Ctrl - Med Virus Ctrl). "Hits" in the single dose screen are those that show inhibition >= 3.42, defined as 3*standard deviation (1.419) above the mean (-0.008) of the % inhibition of the compounds in the full library screen.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock concentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine CRC serial dilutions were prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a one of eight concentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for the Acetylcholine CRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence of a fixed high concentration (30 uM final concentration) of each test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). This compound shifted the EC50 of acetylcholine in the calcium flux assay by greater than 13 fold. The compound was assigned 'Outcome' as 'Active' and 'Score' as '100'.

Description:  The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. This counter screens for hit toxicity in MDCK cells, along with the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. Protocol:  Cytotoxicity was evaluated using Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34). This assay was conducted with 999 of the 1205 compounds designated as active in the confirmation and counterscreens.  Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown and incubated with compounds in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS, for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal. Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that inhibit regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) To screen for compounds that inhibit the RGS4 protein, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses M3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered agonist hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor inhibitors will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells. Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15 ug/ml Blasticidin, 400 ug/ml G418, 200 ug/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2 uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 ul of 7x EC20 (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z prime factors [26] 14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12 15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B score ratio>3*SD+mean), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation plus or minus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an inhibitor of RGS4.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Int(((Log(ABS(B score ratio))-0.6)/1.25)*100), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B score ratio), B score ratio, as in the result definition.  The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0. List of reagents 1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider) 2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Catalog number 10010049) 3.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of compounds to act as activators of Hsp70 expression. Induction of the heat shock response by test compound is measured in a Hela cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter under control of the human Hsp70 promoter. As designed, a compound that acts as an activator of Hsp70 expression will activate the Hsp70 promoter, which will increase luciferase transcription, and thus increase well luminescence as detected with the appropriate substrate.  Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 10 micromolar. The hsp70.1pr-luc HeLa cell line was grown in tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% pen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture and 1% Geneticin at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended in growth media as above at a concentration of 750,000 cells/mL. Next, 5 ul of well-mixed cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (3,750 cells per well).  After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% (RH), the assay was started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound  in DMSO to sample wells, DMSO alone (1% final concentration) to negative control wells, or MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to positive control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the H-4-II-E cell line which is derived from rat hepatoma. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the H-4-II-E cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Assay:  Dense granule release of platelet-rich plasma (PRP).  Expired units of PRP obtained from various blood centers were plated in 384-well white assay plates (Aurora, 00030721) on average of 15,600,000 platelets/well in 20ul.  PRP was exposed to 7.5uM compounds from the MLPCN collection or various doses of the positive control, Cilostazol (Sigma #C0737, Lot# 042K4704, BRD-K67017579-001-04-2 ) for 30 minutes prior to addition of the thrombin receptor (Par1) activator SFLLRN (5uM, Bachem, H-8365) and detection reagent CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G755) using a modified protocol, for measurement of ATP released from the dense granules. PBS is used in place of CellTiter-Glo Buffer thus preventing platelet lysis and a high background of ATP.  Luminescence measurements are taken 15 minutes after reagent addition. Outcome:  A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit the release of dense granules from the platelets, or inhibit the luciferase enzyme.  Normalization of the HTS data across runs and calibration to the positive was performed as described below.  The results are reported as % inhibition.  Specificity for platelet inhibition will be determined in a secondary assay.

Description:  Fluorescence polarization-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the serine hydrolase family member Fam108b. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based counterscreen for RBBP9 inhibitors: primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the serine hydrolase family member Fam108b" (AID 1947). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant Fam108b protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108b inhibitors will prevent Fam 108b-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.51 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108b protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Catalytically dead Fam108b (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay Buffer was dispensed to positive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.0.951% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) Where: Low_Control is defined as the median value of wells containing Fam108b. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108b in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108b (S170A) protein in the presence of DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter; any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-3, for inactive 3-0.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence-based dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1P2) counterscreen assay. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether powder samples of compounds identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107) were nonselective agonists as assayed by activation of S1P2. A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used to measure S1P2 agonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. Stimulation of the S1P2 receptor by agonist increases BLA gene transcription. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay was initiated by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate (6,000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 50 uM, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 uL of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 370 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 2.2 uL of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Selected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.

Description:  Modified NIH3T3, transformed to express firefly luciferase under the control of a HSF-1 response element, will be exposed to small molecules.  After 30min exposure to small molecules, proteasome inhibitor MG132 is added to elicit a stress response. After 8hr incubation in the presence of this stressor, the amount of HSF-1 mediated luciferase expression is measured using a luminescence detection reagent. Expected Outcome: Identification of HSF-1 inhibitors in those instances where there is a loss of luminescence signal due to the prevention of HSF-1 being able to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter. Potential false positives in this assay included those compounds which act not by specifically inhibiting HSF-1, but by inhibiting luciferase or are broad spectrum inhibitors of transcription/translation. HGL HSF-1 luciferase assay: The NIH3T3-HGL cell line is modified version of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with an integrated eGFP-Firefly luciferase fusion construct under the control of a Heat shock response element. The NIH3T3-HGL cell line was generously provided for this study by Luke Whitesell. The HGL cell line is propagated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, cat# 31985-088) supplemented with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, cat# 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, cat# 10378-016) at 37'C in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening (HTS) assays, cells are grown in T225 flask (BD Falcon, cat# 353138) or Hyperflasks (Corning, cat# 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using Accumax cell detachment solution (Innovative Cell Technologies, cat# AM105). Cell number is counted using a Cellometer Auto M10 cell counter (Nexelcom Bioscience) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS. Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform General system (GS) automation unit: Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  HGL cells are harvested and re-suspended in Opti-MEM with 2.5% Heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. HGL cells (from an initial cell suspension of 200,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, cat# 8867BC) at a final density of 4,000 cells per well in final volume of 20 uL. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing. 2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) and  incubated for 24 hours at 37'C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (General automation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate): 3.The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators STX1000#1 and #2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 before the initiation of the pinning run. The In-plate positive control compound plate (sentinel) (25uM Rocaglamide A (RocA), Alexis Biochemicals ALX-350-121-C100), or vehicle (DMSO only) are already present in the Liconic incubator 8 at the beginning of the pinning. Both STX and Liconic 8 CO2 incubator temperature are kept at 20'C. MLPCN test compounds plates are pinned as well as the in-plate positive control (32 wells, 50nM final conc. RocA) are pinned consecutively one after the other and transferred into one assay plate. Each compound plate is pinned into duplicate assay plates.  The final concentration for the MLPCN test compounds is 7.5uM with final concentration no more than 1% DMSO. 4.   After 30min incubation with the compounds, 50uM MG132 (Enzo, cat# PI-102) in 1X PBS (Invitrogen, cat# 10010) is added in 1uL with the CombinL (Thermo) (2.5uM final conc. MG132) to induce HSF-1. The cells are incubated in the presence of MG132 for a further 8hrs.  (Reading luminescence from assay plates with Envision): 5.   After 8 hr incubation, 20uL of Steady-Glo luciferase (Promega, cat# E2550) is added to each assay plate using a MultiDrop Combi (Thermo). Luminescence is measured in each well (0.1 second/well) using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-002) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process.  Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators.  Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP.  23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and AC100 inhibition (no enzyme). To monitor activation, the first column contained a titration of the activator, NCGC00031955-01 (16-point 1:2 dilutions in duplicate starting at 57 uM) and the first 16 rows of column 4 contained 57 uM of NCGC00031955-01.

Description:  Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  The goal of this project is to identify small molecule antagonists of GPR35, which may aid in characterization of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR35 in addictive behavior. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to clathrin-coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.  When this receptor is blocked by an antagonist, this arrestin-GFP redistribution is inhibited and can be detected as a decrease in local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins as compared to the agonist activity.  Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: 2.0% DMSO diluted in PBS 5) Agonist Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis # ALX-430-020-M010 - 10mg, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in PBS to 100uM 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor b (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. The purpose of this assay to use HTS to identify inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb. This is accomplished by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay.  When added together Cerulean-Runt domain and Venus-CBFb will bind and allow for energy transfer.  If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the FRET signal will be abated.  This assay can be a counterscreen for AID:1434. Assay materials: 1) Cerulean-Runt domain, Venus-CBFb and unlabeled-CBFb was provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA).  uHTS protocol: 1) The protein complex (PC); 100nM Cerulean-Runt domain, 100nM Venus-CBFb in 50mM Tris pH7.5, 100mM KCl, 10mM K2SO4, 2mM Mg2SO4, and 0.01% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature. 2) After 1 hour 4ul of PC is dispensed into columns 3 through 48 of a black 1536 well plate (Corning #3724) 3) 4ul of positive control (PC + 5uM unlabeled CBFb) is added to the wells in columns 1 and 2. 4) 40nl of 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns 1 through 4, while 40nl of 2mM compounds in 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns  5 through 48.  Final compound concentration is 20uM, final DMSO concentration is 1%. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) After 1 hour the plate is read on a BMG Pherastar 422ex, 530em and 480em 7) Raw values are the ratio of 530/480 signals.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to measure p97 ATPase inhibition" (PubChem AID 1481), and that confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the p97 ATPase" (PubChem AID 1517) act as covalent or non-covalent p97 inhibitors. This biochemical assay employs a mutant Cys522Ala p97 protein as the target. The assay uses the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97Cys522Ala will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Prior to the start of the assay 18 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 um) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2, rows O and P of 384-well assay plates. The remaining wells were filled with 18 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM C522A p97 protein. Next, 50 nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 100 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 20 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 24 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and luminescence was measured by the Envision microplate reader.

Description:  The E3 ligases are involved in regulating other proteins by covalent ligation to the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin. This post-translational modification can result in altered conformation, altered activity, or degradation of the substrate protein. Thus, E3 ligases are effectors of a major means of post-translational modification of proteins in many species, including mammals. The dipeptide boronic acid bortezomib is a potent proteasome inhibitor, has selective anticancer activity in tumor cells and in mice and was recently approved for clinical use in multiple myeloma. MDM2 E3 ligase is involved in numerous types of human cancer. Selective E3 ligase inhibitors would be preferable as they would be more selective and less toxic. Inhibitors of the MDM2-UBCH5 interaction should disrupt the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 and therefore its oncogenic activity. Such inhibitors could be developed into novel therapeutic agents for sarcomas involving MDM2 overexpression or amplification, irrespective of their p53 status. Patients with sarcomas are likely to benefit from this approach because of their high frequency of MDM2 protein overexpression and MDM2 gene amplification. Cellular autoubiquitination assay: an MDM2-GFP fusion protein autoubiquitinates and autodegrades in vivo. This approach was adapted to luciferase, because luciferase is easier to detect in high-throughput assays. A cellular assay for autoubiquitination in 384-well format was designed. An MDM2 E3-luciferase fusion protein was stably transfected into mammalian cells. The fusion protein autoubiquitinates, targeting itself for degradation. Luminescence is used to monitor protein abundance. A negative control of inactive RING domains fused to luciferase, known to have no ubiquitination activity, has been developed as a counterscreen. We have used a cell-based MDM2 autoubiquitination screen to identify small molecules that inhibit MDM2 E3 ligase activity. The cell based assay uses full-length MDM2 fused to luciferase. This construct autoubiquitinates itself and autodegrades. The screen will identify compounds that prevent this autodegradation and stabilize the MDM2-luciferase construct by blocking MDM2 E3 ligase activity. Thus inhibitors will show an enhanced luminescence signal. We have earlier screened 218,724 compounds of the MLSCN library (AID 1230) and identified 220 actives. Of these, only 200 compounds were available from DPI for retesting. We report here the dose-response testing on these 200 compounds. Cells were plated and allowed to settle at 37C overnight. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of compound (final DMSO conc:0.25%) at 37C for 2 hrs. SteadyLite luciferase reagent was added, plates incubated for 30 mins and then read on Envision reader. Dose-response protocol 1.Fill 384 well plate with 24 uL of cells in DMEM (7500 cells per well) using Wellmate (all columns except 1 and 23) 2.Add 24 uL DMEM to columns 1 and 23 using Wellmate 3. Seal plates with Breathe-easy membranes and incubate at 37C overnight 4.Dilute 1 ul of compound from dose-response plate with 79 ul DMEM to get a diluted dose-response plate (top concentration 125 uM) 5. Add 6 ul of diluted compound to the overnight-grown cells, seal with Breathe-easy membrane and incubate at 37C for 2 hrs 6.Add 30 ul SteadyLite HTS reagent and incubate at room temperature for 30 min 7.Read luminescence on Envision reader

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "S1P3 Agonist Primary HTS and Confirmation Assays" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information on the previous set of experiments can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID = 373.  A cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism. If the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment, 69 compounds that passed hit selection criteria were tested to determine individual EC50 values. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. S1P was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar S1P (i.e. 100% activation). In this assay, S1P had a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of approximately 200 nM. Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (45 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition, the EC50 was determined manually as > 45 micromolar. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 45 micromolar and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 45 micromolar. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. The S1P positive control was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.

Description:  Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of the oxidoreductase glutathione S-transferase omega 1(GSTO1). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based counterscreen for RBBP9 inhibitors: primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the oxidoreductase glutathione S-transferase omega 1(GSTO1)" (AID 1974). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)" (AID 1515). The oxidoreductase GSTO1 has a catalytic cysteine residue and is sensitive to thiol alkylating agents such as Nethylmaleimide. In this assay, recombinant GSTO1 protein is incubated with test compounds and a Rh-conjugated sulfonate ester (SE) activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as GSTO1 inhibitors will prevent GSTO1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1.25 micromolar of GSTO1-1 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM PS-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Prior to reading, plates were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular) on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) Where: Low_Control is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no GSTO1-1 enzyme. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-11, for inactive 11-0. List of Reagents: Recombinant GSTO1-1 (supplied by Assay Provider) PS-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider) Tris HCl (Sigma, part T3038) NaCl (Sigma, part S6546) Pluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176) DTT (Sigma, part D9779)

Description:  Counterscreen for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: Fluorescence-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay for compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) in triplicate" (AID 1945). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)", (AID 1800) to determine whether the compounds are nonselective due to direct DNA binding. In this biochemical assay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent intercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the intercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will compete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 79.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene aceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin oligonucleotide. Well fluorescence was read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent Displacement = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 79.4 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 79.4 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for inactive compounds is 100-0. There are no actives. List of Reagents: DNA hairpin oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized) Intercalating agent (Ethidium Bromide) (Bio-Rad, part 161-0433) Diminazene Aceturate (Sigma-Aldrich, part D7770) MOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100) 1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonists: cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the parental CHO cell line, in triplicate. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous assays entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 434989) and inactive in a set of previous assays entitled, "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonists: cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO cell line" (AID 463079) are nonselective inhibitors of Gq signaling. In this assay, the parental CHO cell line (not transfected with any GPCRs) is used to monitor inhibition of Gq activity by test compound. Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 5.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP). A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones. These results comprise confirmation of hits from primary screening in a purified enzyme assay. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at 440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). The AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of NPY-Y1," (PubChem AID 1040). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3,600 Y1 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (25 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 micromolar final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary HTS assay for 5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) Receptor Subtype 1a (5HT1a) agonists" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID = 567. A cell line containing the human 5-HT1a receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15) as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure 5-HT1a agonism. When the 5-HT1a receptor is agonized, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity is proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. As with the primary HTS assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human 5HT1a receptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-15 promiscuous coupling protein was used (Invitrogen, part K1083). Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 3 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 50ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.5 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 2% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Immediately after this step, 50 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added to the appropriate wells. The selective 5HT1a agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was also added (50nL) to positive control wells to a final concentration of 1.25 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  The activity of MK was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of absorbance (OD340) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. Compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 10 uM. Three hundred and twenty compounds that had the highest %inhibition were scored as hits. These hits were then tested in dose response at ten concentrations, ranging from 100 uM to 0.196 uM. To confirm that the compounds were specifically inhibiting MK and not one of the other enzymes in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes'. Mevalonate Kinase Protocol for 384-well HTS Final Assay Conditions in 26 ul total volume: 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 6 mM MgCl2 5 mM ATP 0.2 mM Mevalonate 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.4 mM NADH 3 units/ml rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 3 units/ml rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase 60 nM Mevalonate Kinase (MK) 4% DMSO Background conditions are the same as above except that the substrate (mevalonate) is left out.  The assay is run in 384 well clear non-binding plates. Fifteen ul substrate/background is added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds are then added in 1 ul volumes using the FX. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 10 ul of MK using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the PS had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing MK with hexokinase.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. As one method of confirming the specific activity of compounds active in the primary screen (AID 1461), we developed an assay to measure the displacement of radio-labeled native ligand, NPS, from its receptor in vitro. The lack of displacement does not necessarily indicate that a compound is non-specific for the NPS receptor, rather, it indicates that the binding site is unlikely to be the same as the native ligand. The assay was carried out as described with minor modification. Y10-NPS labeled with 125I was bought from NEN Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA). CHO cells stably expressing human NPSR were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured until reaching 90-95% confluency. Cells were washed with 1ml PBS once and then incubated with radioligand with or without compounds or in DMEM medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 20C for 1.5 hr. Increasing concentrations of compounds or unlabeled human NPS were used to compete with 0.15 nM [125I] Y10-NPS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM unlabeled human NPS. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 1 N NaOH. Bound radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-004) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative disorders has been a disappointment when compared to the successes obtained in stroke, other neurological diseases like seizures, and in mental health diseases. It has to be said that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and their early diagnosis represent a definite obstacle to effective intervention. Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a key cellular signaling factor in the central nervous system. Although NF-kB signaling pathways have been extensively investigated in cancer and in immunological diseases, NF-kB role in the central nervous system physiology and pathology in non inflammatory disorders of the brain is still unclear. NF-kB has an important role as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis and at least in this capacity it represents an interesting target to pursue. Recent evidence has also pointed out that this signaling system is involved in the resilience of neurons and in their ability to survive disparate insults. Functional knock out models of NF-kB, achieved via over-expression of its natural repressor I-kB, have shown that neurons from these animals are more sensitive to insults including trauma, Beta-amyloid toxicity and excitotoxicity. Also a direct neuroprotective effect from both non apoptotic and apoptotic models of neurodegeneration has been attributed to direct or indirect activation of NF-kB signaling. In addition, to the direct neuroprotective effect NF-kB up-regulation could also be of value in improving learning and memory. In fact, NF-kB signaling has been shown to improve long term potentiation and long term depression, two models of learning at cellular level. This background is of great appeal because up regulation of NF-kB in neurons could be useful in attacking, at the same time, neuronal degeneration and deterioration of neuronal functions associated with loss of learning and memory as seen in Alzheimer#s disease. To pursue this scope, we have set up a novel human cell-based assay to identify small molecules able to up-regulate NF-kB expression for high throughput screening. The cell line developed for this assay, which is used to identify pharmacological probes for the activation of NF-kB, was prepared as follows. The SH-5YSY human neuroblastoma cell line was doubly stably transfected with a reporter construct coding the human NF-kB promoter driving the expression of the firefly luciferase and a reporter coding the resistance to the antibiotic blasticidin. TNF-alpha was used as a positive control as it a potent enhancer of NF-kB expression.  Negative control wells were treated with vehicle only. Cell Culture:  SH-5YSY (ATCC) cells stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the human NF-kB promoter fused upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter and blasticidin resistance (clone C1) were subcultured every 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) high glucose (1X) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate + 10% FBS + 3 ug/mL of blasticidin, and incubated at 37C in 5% CO2, and maintained at a subconfluent density of no more than 240,000 cells/cm2 for less than 30 passages. Cell Culture Reagents used: 1. D-MEM high glucose (1X), liquid, with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate Invitrogen: 11995-065 2. Blasticidin S HCl Invitrogen:  R210-01 Assay Conditions: 1.

Description:  Dose response counterscreen for agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GalR2): a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for activators of beta-lactamase activity The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2)" (PubChem AID 864).  Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of approximately 56 micromolar.  This assay also serves to determine whether these compounds were assay artifact due to non-specific activation of the beta-lactamase reporter gene or interference with the assay readout.  In this assay a cell line stably expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used.  Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.  As designed, a compound that increases FRET is considered a non-selective BLA activator. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.25 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of 1536-well plates (1000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours. After this incubation, test compound in DMSO (0.5% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 microliter of PBS (control wells) or thapsigargin in PBS (positive control wells; 500 nM final concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells. Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1 ul per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, well fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 0.5 uM thapsigargin in PBS. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e., 56 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 56 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  The purpose of this bioluminescent biochemical assay is to identify compounds that inhibit the activity of the deubiquitinating enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV or Luciferase. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, "QFRET-based dose response biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS coronavirus 3C-like Protease (3CLPro)," (PubChem AID 1890). In this coupled-enzyme assay, test compounds are incubated with recombinant PLpro enzyme and an ubiquitin C-terminal RLRGG-derivatized aminoluciferin substrate, in the presence of luciferase and ATP. PLpro-mediated deubiquitination and cleavage of substrate releases aminoluciferin, which acts as a luciferase substrate, leading to an increase in well luminescence. The light signal is proportional to PLpro activity. As designed, compounds that act as PLpro inhibitors will prevent PLpro-mediated substrate deubiquitination and cleavage, thus preventing release of aminoluciferin, leading to no increase in well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 60 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay, a mixture of PLpro peptide substrate and luciferase detection reagent was made up in assay buffer (50mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM Magnesium sulfate) at pH 7.5 and incubated for 60 min. The assay was begun by dispensing 2.5 microliters of PLpro enzyme (7.5 nM final concentration) in assay buffer or assay buffer alone into each well of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Next, the enzyme reaction was initiated by dispensing 2.5 microliters of the preincubated mixture containing PLpro peptide substrate and luciferase detection reagent (1 micromolar final substrate concentration). Finally, well luminescence was read on a PerkinElmer Viewlux after 60 minutes of incubation at room temperature.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-017) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the Jurkat cell line (Clone E6-1) which is derived from the human T cell leukemia. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the Jurkat cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The high-throughput screen for complement factor C1s inhibitors has been reported earlier (AID 538). The assay consisted of an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled tripeptide. The MLSCN compound library was screened as mixtures of 10 compounds per well. Active compounds were confirmed by single compound IC50 determination. The IC50 is reported in this submission. This assay is a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN). Activated human complement factor C1s was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #204879). Substrate Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1105.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 M sodium chloride, and 0.2% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Complement factor C1s (0.02 mg/mL) was incubated with Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 2.5 hr at room temperature. IC50 was performed using a serial dilution of compounds from 50 uM to 75 nM. All IC50 determinations were done in triplicate. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.04 mg/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 2.5 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1040) were nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of the Y2 receptor. A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. As designed, test compounds that increase probe fluorescence in Y2 cells are considered non-selective antagonists. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 25 nL of either test compound (2.8 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO, High Control (0.28 uM final nominal concentration BIIE0246) or Low Control (1 uM DMSO) was added to the appropriate wells. Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (8 nM final nominal concentration; NPY's EC95) in PBS. The plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 micromolar final concentration; isoproterenol's EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (25 micromolar final concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before the final read using the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T30 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T30 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 30 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control)))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge High_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Assay Rationale and Summary: Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped Gram-negative enterobacteria that causes typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and foodborne illness. Salmonella enterica, serovar Typhimurium, is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis (acute intestinal inflammation), and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. Serovar Typhi is the cause of the human disease typhoid fever. Every year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thirty or more times greater. The most recent outbreak in the US occurred in April, 2008. Young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to develop severe infections. The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than five years old is about five times higher than the rate in all other persons. The incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year. S. typhi infections occur worldwide but primarily in developing nations where sanitary conditions are poor. Early antibiotic therapy has transformed a previously life-threatening illness of several weeks' duration with an overall mortality rate approaching 20% into a short-term febrile illness with negligible mortality. However, case fatality rates of 10-50% have been reported from endemic countries when diagnosis is delayed. Typhoid fevers are endemic in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, affects 13-17 million people yearly, and kills an estimated 600,000. The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells, respectively. The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ. The gene products are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica. During the past year the assay provider's group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi. They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as PhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing versus inducing conditions for each of the promoters. He has used these reporters in Salmonella serovar Typhi to create a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for identifying compounds that specifically inhibit PhoP induction. To this end, our team has developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the PhoP virulence regulon of S. enterica which may lead to the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection. The proposed primary assays, counter screens, and secondary assays, which utilize quantitative, established techniques, will allow identification of hits, confirmation of target specificity, and the prioritization of assay chemical probes. The primary screening GFP expression assay in Salmonella typhi was used to determine PhoP regulation by measuring expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene fused to the promoter for PhoP. During bacterial growth, fluorescence was determined in PhoP inducing (low Mg2+, 10uM) conditions in the presence of test compounds. Controls included (high Mg2+, 10mM) to simulate compounds that would repress PhoP. Primary Assay Conditions:  The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Media for the S. typhi virK-GFP and nmpC-GFP consisted of 1X standard M9MM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.0021% Tryptophan, 0.0037% Cysteine, 0.0016% Histidine, 0055% Thymidine, 0.00169% Thiamine, 5uM FeSO4, and 20uM CaCl2.  Initially, 25nl of test compound (50uM final concentration) in 100% DMSO was added to the respective plate wells. Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 550 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Culture and media volumes were dispensed using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).  Cultures were grown overnight in media containing 2mM MgCl2.  The next morning, 20 ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged, washed in media without MgCl2, then inoculated into 150ml of media containing either 10uM MgCl2 (for PhoP-GFP induction) or 10mM MgCl2 (for PhoP-GFP suppression), and grown to an OD of approximately 0.2.  The cultures were then dispensed into the plates (preplated with compounds, final compound concentration was 50uM) and incubated for 4h at 37C.  Final DMSO concentration was 1%.  Endpoint addition and read:  After incubation, the plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 480/535nm respectively. Controls and Drug Addition: Controls included high/low Mg2+ (10mM/10uM) wells (media and DMSO blank).  No control drug was available for this assay, so high Mg2+ simulated compounds that would repress the PhoP gene and reduce GFP expression.  25nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 50uM. DMSO concentration was maintained at 1% for all wells of each plate. Data Analysis: 128 high Mg2+ wells and 128 low Mg2+ wells per plate were used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z Factor for the primary assay was 0.7.  Data were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - Low Mg2+ Control)/(High Mg2+ Control - Low Mg2+ Control). The dose response data was analyzed using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and minimum locked at 100 and 0. From these curves IC50 values were calculated.

Description:  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for drug discovery. The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)-protein family has important roles in GPCR signal transduction. RGS proteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signaling regulatory elements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signaling; however, some also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS inhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional specificity.  The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated distributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system disorders. Inhibitors of the RGS:GPCR interaction should prove useful as small molecule tools in this research field. A complex of Gai1 and fluorescently labeled G-alpha-binding peptide (the "GoLoco motif") derived from RGS12 is incubated with library members. Inhibitors of the binding are detected by a decrease in the fluorescence polarization (FP) of the fluorophore. Assay Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM GDP (prepared fresh), and 0.05% NP40 at pH 7.5. Controls: 10 nM FITC labeled peptide dispensed into columns 3 and 4 to generate negative control (full inhibition of binding, -100 % activity). Four uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid-bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager using FITC polarization filter sets for the fluorescein-labeled decapeptide probe.During dispense, reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath and all liquid lines were covered with aluminum foil to minimize probe and protein degradation. All screening operations were performed on a Kalypsys robotic system (Kalypsys, Inc., San Diego, CA) containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 anthropomorphic robotic arms.

Description:  LYP, is a lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical regulatory role in T cell receptor signaling. The PTPN22 gene encodes this phosphatase. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in PTPN22 is associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Grave's disease. The autoimmunity-predisposing allele is a gain-of-function mutant suggesting that a specific small-molecule inhibitor could eliminate its effect. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate methyl-fluorescein from 3-O-methylflyorescein phosphate (OMFP). Assay materials: 1) LYP (LYPCAT) was produced at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute's protein production core facility 2) Assay Buffer: 20mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 1mM DTT, 0.005% Tween-20 3) 3-O-Methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) cyclohexylammonium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, M2629) Dose response protocol: 1) Dispense 10 ul of 200 uM OMFP in assay buffer into all columns of black 384-well small-volume Greiner plates (786076) 2) Dispense 10 uL of assay buffer in columns 1-2. 3) Using Labcyte Echo550, dispense 200 nL of serially diluted compounds to columns 3-22 and DMSO to columns 1-2 and 23-24. Final concentration of DMSO was 1 % 4) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi, dispense 10 uL of 3 nM LYPCAT working solution to wells in columns 3 through 24. 5) Incubate lidded plate for 30 min. at room temp. 6) Read plate on M5 plate reader in fluorescence mode (Ex: 480nm, Em: 520nm)

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor beta (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. The purpose of this assay to use HTS to identify inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb. This assay is a counterscreen for the primary screening assay.  This is accomplished by using a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay.  If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the TR-FRET signal will be abated. Assay materials: 1) Venus-CBFb, His-CBFa and His-CBFb were provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA). 2) Tb-anti-His (Invitrogen) uHTS protocol: 1) The protein complex (PC); 100nM His-CBFa, 100nM Venus-CBFb, 1nM Tb-anti-His in 50mM Tris pH7.5, 100mM KCl, 10mM K2SO4, 2mM Mg2SO4, and 0.01% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature. 2) After 1 hour 4ul of PC is dispensed into columns 3 through 48 of a white 1536 well plate 3) 4ul of positive control (PC + 1.25uM His-CBFb) is added to the wells in columns 1 and 2. 4) 40nl of 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns 1 through 4, while 40nl of 2mM compounds in 100% DMSO is added to wells in columnsd 5 through 48.  Final compound concentration is 20uM, final DMSO concentration is 1%. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) After 1 hour the plate is read on a BMG Pherastar using a Lanthascreen filter set: 337ex, 520em and 490em 7) Raw values are the ratio of 520/490 signals * 10,000.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-M2 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-M2 and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  In this counterscreen, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene, but lacking the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion that was present in the primary screening cell line (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to off target effects. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well.  Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the pGL-3 LUC gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL compound, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.  The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  b-galactosidase (b-gal), a hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of b-galactosides to monosaccharides is utilized in many different screening technologies involving enzyme reaction coupling and reporter assays, for example DiscoverX  b-Arrestin GPCR  assays such as the APJ Agonist or Antagonist.  This assay was developed and performed as a counterscreen for screening assays that utilize b-gal and a reaction that it catalyzes. By detecting inhibitors and activators of this enzyme, it is possible to attribute activity not to the primary assay in question, but rather to interaction with the method of detection. Assay materials: 1) Beta-Galactosidase from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat# G4155) 2) Assay Medium: Opti-MEM Medium supplemented with 1% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) 3) DiscoverX b-Arrestin Detection Reagents: Galacton Star, Emerald II, and Cell Assay Buffer Dose Response protocol: 1) Add 5.0 uL of b-gal diluted in assay media to 0.03 U/mL to all wells (0.02 U/mL final assay concentration) of a 1536-well plate with the exception of the positive control wells where 5.0 uL of assay media alone is added. 2) Spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 3) Prepare Detection Reagent Solution from DiscoveRx (1 part Galacton Star: 5 parts Emerald II and 19 parts Cell Assay Buffer). 4) Using a Labcyte Echo, DMSO and test compounds are transferred to assay wells. DMSO only is transferred to positive and negative control wells, while varying volumes of test compounds are transferred to test compound wells to achieve the desired test concentrations. Test compound wells in the assay plate are back-filled with DMSO to equalize final assay concentrations. 5) Spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 6) Add 2.5 uL of Detection Reagent Solution to all wells of assay plate and immediately spin plates at 500 rpm for 1 min. 7) After 15 minutes, read assay plates on a Perkin Elmer Envision using a luminescence protocol

Description:  S1P3 Dose Response Assay Counterscreen for 5-Hydroxytryptamine(Serotonin) Receptor Subtype 1E A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-16 promiscuous coupling protein was used.  Compounds specific for the 5HT1E receptor should not activate beta-lactamase expression in this cell-line. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 200ug/ml Hygromycin(Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate and the plate is ncubate overnight at 37 C, 5% C02 in a humidified incubator.  43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added to the appropriate wells. S1P, the agonist for the S1P3 receptor was added to positive control wells to a final concentration of 0.3 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity (EC80). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm.  The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/(median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 The positive control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the negative controls wells were treated with the EC80 of S1P. For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 40 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 40 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This result in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play vital roles in numerous cellular processes and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases, ranging from cancer to cardiovascular, immunological, infectious, neurological, and metabolic diseases. The Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) PTP is a dual-specific Erk and Jnk phosphatase, the loss of which causes specific cell cycle arrest in HeLa carcinoma cells, suggesting that VHR inhibition may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer cells without detrimental effects on normal cells. Recent studies by collaborators and us suggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate phosphate from p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "HTS Colorimetric assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit VHR1" (AID 1992) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Ki Determination.  Ki values were determined for the top 56 compounds in AID 1992, "HTS Colorimetric assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit VHR1", averaging 90% inhibition or higher in both, primary and confirmatory screen.  The PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of compound was assayed at 30 oC in a 100 uL 96-well format reaction system in 150 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0 assay buffer having an ionic strength of 150 mM (adjusted with NaCl) and containing 1 mM DTT and 5% DMSO. The enzyme was preincubated with various fixed concentrations of inhibitors for 10 min.  The reaction was initiated by addition of various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.2 to 10 Km) to the reaction mixture.  The initial rate was determined using an ELx808 micro plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), reading the absorbance of the product p-nitrophenol at 404 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme.  The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern was evaluated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equations for either competitive, uncompetitive or mixed inhibition as described before (1), using nonlinear regression and the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).  For a comparison of the fitting results the second-order Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) was calculated as previously described.

Description:  TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to prevent dimerization of the hydrophilic N-terminal domain (residues 1-106; core106) of the HCV core protein (9). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies, blocking the transfer of energy from Europium to XL-665, and thus inhibiting well FRET. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000 Where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 41 and the active compounds have an activity score range of 41 to 100.

Description:  Modified NIH3T3, transformed to express firefly luciferase under the control of a HSF-1 response element, will be exposed to small molecules.  After 30min exposure to small molecules, proteasome inhibitor MG132 is added to elicit a stress response. After 8hr incubation in the presence of this stressor, the amount of HSF-1 mediated luciferase expression is measured using a luminescence detection reagent.  Expected Outcome: Identification of HSF-1 inhibitors in those instances where there is a loss of luminescence signal due to the prevention of HSF-1 being able to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter. Potential false positives in this assay included those compounds which act not by specifically inhibiting HSF-1, but by inhibiting luciferase or are broad spectrum inhibitors of transcription/translation. HGL HSF-1 luciferase assay: The NIH3T3-HGL cell line is modified version of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with an integrated eGFP-Firefly luciferase fusion construct under the control of a heat shock response element. The NIH3T3-HGL cell line was generously provided for this study by Luke Whitesell.  The HGL cell line is propagated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, cat 31985-088) supplemented with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, cat 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, cat 10378-016) at 37C in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening (HTS) assays, cells are grown in T225 flask (BD Falcon, cat 353138) or Hyperflasks (Corning, cat 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using Accumax cell detachment solution (Innovative Cell Technologies, cat AM105). Cell number is counted using a Cellometer Auto M10 cell counter (Nexelcom Bioscience) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS.  Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform General system (GS) automation unit:  Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  HGL cells are harvested and re-suspended in Opti-MEM with 2.5% Heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. HGL cells (from an initial cell suspension of 200,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, cat 8867BC) at a final density of 4,000 cells per well in final volume of 20 &#956;L. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing.  2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) and  incubated for 24 hours at 37C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (General automation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity.  Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate):  3.The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators STX1000 1 and 2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 before the initiation of the pinning run. The In-plate positive control compound plate (sentinel) (25&#956;M Rocaglamide A (RocA), Alexis Biochemicals ALX-350-121-C100), or vehicle (DMSO only) are already present in the Liconic incubator 8 at the beginning of the pinning. Both STX and Liconic 8 CO2 incubator temperature are kept at 20C. MLPCN test compounds plates are pinned as well as the in-plate positive control (32 wells, 50nM final conc. RocA) are pinned consecutively one after the other and transferred into one assay plate. Each compound plate is pinned into duplicate assay plates.  The final concentration for the MLPCN test compounds is 7.5&#956;M with final concentration no more than 1% DMSO.  4. After 30min incubation with the compounds, 50M MG132 (Enzo, cat PI-102) in 1X PBS (Invitrogen, cat 10010) is added in 1L with the CombinL (Thermo) (2.5uM final conc. MG132) to induce HSF-1. The cells are incubated in the presence of MG132 for a further 8hrs.  (Reading luminescence from assay plates with Envision): 5.   After 8 hr incubation, 20L of Steady-Glo luciferase (Promega, cat E2550) is added to each assay plate using a MultiDrop Combi (Thermo). Luminescence is measured in each well (0.1 second/well) using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting).

Description:  TR-FRET dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma): non-selective agonists. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)" (PubChem AID 1032) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)" (AID 1297). This assay tests the ability of test compounds to increase interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC2, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2 protein [aa 624-829]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 54 and active compounds range of activity score is 54 to 100.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 10uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO (Sigma D8418) 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Ras family members (Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb among others) are recognized their control of growth factor receptor signaling cascades.  When mutant or hyperactivated, Ras family members contribute contribute to ongogenesis.  The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran protein controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. Ran is the subject of an independent screening initiative and Arf family members are membrane anchored via their N-termini in contrast to other family members, which are anchored via their C-termini. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases.  Proper functioning of Ras and Ras-related GTPases is regulated at the level of localization and nucleotide binding and hydrolysis.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The assay described here is a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases are simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library.  The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.   Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a well.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab7 there are only 69 missing compounds. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be 'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0). Assessment of fluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the proteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are calculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this difference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT; CompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL with RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control fluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL from the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are calculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very similar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential fluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab7 there are only 4,094 fluorescent compounds.  There are 11 compounds out of these fluorescent compounds that have been labeled as "Possible Red Fluorescent Compound" due to a shift in events observed in the red fluorescent channel (665 nm) that is utilized for distinquishing the different bead types. Due to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound.  Whole plate trends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then due to the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (notated with WPcalc) is utilized for calculating % activity normalized by whole plate: % Activity = 100 x (SampleFL - NCntrl)/(PCntrl_WPcalc -NCntrl) where all variables are Median Fluorescence Intensity associated with the bead set bound with a specific protein.  SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, PCntrl_WPcalc is the well-specific, calculated value based on whole plate linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is for measurement in presence 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP.  Baseline of % Activity is 100%. Maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 was given for the primary screening.  The absolute difference between baseline and %Activity was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = |100% - %Activity| A compound was considered "Active" if the change in %Activity was greater than 20% from baseline (i.e., PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >=20%). PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for "Active" and 1 for "Non-active".   For "Active" compounds, the type of activity is indicated in column entitled "ActivityType". "Inhibitor" is a compound with <80% Activity and "Activator" is a compound with >120% Activity. Average Zprime for this screen was 0.85 +/- 0.04.

Description:  The thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling pathway was assayed in murine Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with the human TPO receptor and a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the Glycoprotein IIb promoter (provided by Axxam). BaF3 cells are an IL-3-dependent pro B cell line that upon TPO stimulation, undergo cell division and induce the megakaryocyte marker, Glycoprotein IIb. The assay was screened at the EC50 of TPO (26 pM) to identify inhibitors of the pathway. Cells were maintained at 37 C and 5% CO2in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/mL murine IL-3, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Prior to plating, cells were incubated overnight in medium without IL-3. Cells were plated at 250 cells/5uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates, 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool, and 1 uL of TPO (26 pM final concentration in IL-3 deficient medium) was added. Following 24 hrs of incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 4 uL of Steadylite detector mix (PerkinElmer) was added, the plates incubated at room temperature for 10 min and luminescence was measured for 10 s and 2X binning by a ViewLux detector (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic- like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. The purpose of this assay was to test the lead compound for potency against rM4/Gqi5 in a calcium mobilization assay. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%. Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). All compounds showed dose-dependency and therefore were assigned 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100'.

Description:  Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and its receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. This assay is a follow-up to "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ receptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay", AID 2521. A. Brief Description of the Assay: The purpose of this assay is to detect antagonists that inhibit the activation of the Angiotensin II receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well plate format in uHTS mode.

Description:  The GHMP kinase family is a unique class of important enzymes that plays an essential role in many metabolic processes. It contains more than 170 protein members among which are the galactokinase (GALK) and the CMK enzymes. GALK plays a crucial role in galactose processing and is a potential therapeutic target for Classic Galactosemia (OMIM: 230400) [1]. CMK is involved for the non-mevalonate synthesis of isoprenoids precursors and natural products like sterols or ubiquinones which are important to many biological functions [2]. Although the sequence identity between GALK and CMK  is low, the three-dimensional structures and active sites are highly similar [3]. Therefore to determine the validity and selectivity of an active compound observed in the GALK qHTS screen (AID: 1868), a bioluminescent counter-screen targeting bacterial CMK was developed. In addition, because the mevalonate independent synthesis of isoprenoids are more prevalent in opportunistic pathogens such as bacteria [4], CMK is a potential novel therapeutic target where selective inhibitors could be used to  determine potential antibacterial effects. The CMK (provided by Kent Lai) was assayed using ATP and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME; Echelon, cat# I-M052) as substrates.  Promega Kinase-Glo Plus (cat# V3774) technology was used to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. Briefly, the Kinase-Glo Plus contains Ultra-Glo [5] luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the remaining ATP. Kinase reactions run with and without the enzyme were use as negative and positive controls together with treatment of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase CD45 inhibitor (EMD Bioscience cat# 540215) which is observed to weakly inhibit the CMK. Three uL/well of substrate solution (15 uM ATP, 30 uM CDP-ME, 20 mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner, solid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Compound and control solutions (23 nL) were transferred to the assay plate using the Kalypsys 1536-pin tool. One uL/well enzyme solution (0.25 ug/mL CDP-Me kinase, 20 mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was then added using the FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well. After 1 hour of room temperature incubation, 4 uL Kinase-Glo Plus reagent was added for a final assay volume of 8 uL/well. After 1 min, luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using a 1 sec exposure time and 2x binning settings.

Description:  The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2).  STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, the seven STAT family member (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Studies show that STAT3 is activated in a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1, 4, 6). Blocking STAT3 interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers has been shown to reduce tumor growth (7).  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 and STAT3 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). In this assay inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 antagonist will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. The STAT3 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80% STAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 761). In the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and determine potency. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Test compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. Beads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt, Rac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine different concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data points. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand concentrations, generating competition curves. Ligand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. In order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) - [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be statistically significant) - |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of LOGEC50) - |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE) - [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test compound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) - [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the compound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal) The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 - ||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|) In this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive compounds the activity score is 0.

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening assay for inhibitors of the nuclear receptor Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1)" (PubChem AID=525) were selected for further testing in this RAR-related orphan receptor A (RORA) assay. RORA is a nuclear receptor that does not share significant structural homology with SF-1 at the ligand-binding domain. This counterscreen employs the same format as the assay used to select potential SF-1 inhibitors; except that here the biological target is RORA. A compound that appears as an inhibitor in both the SF-1 and RORA assays would be less desirable for follow-up, since the compound may be a non-selective inhibitor or format-specific artifact. On the other hand, compounds found inactive in this assay and confirmed active in SF-1 dose-response experiments are likely to be selective inhibitors of SF-1. This dose-response counterscreen assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor RORA (encoded by the pFA-hRORA plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hRORA and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated RORA nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute false-positives inhibitors of the SF-1 nuclear receptor. Three hundred and fifty nine (359) compounds selected during the primary screen were assessed in this dose-response experiment in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. Dose response results for two substances have been invalidated and are not reported.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the H-4-II-E cell line which is derived from rat hepatoma. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the H-4-II-E cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence-based dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1) counterscreen assay. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether powder samples of compounds identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107) were nonselective agonists as assayed by activation of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 1 (EDG1; S1P1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 ug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 275,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate (10,000 cells/well), followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (40 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Selected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value > 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100, and for inactive compounds 0-0.

Description:  QFRET-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS coronavirus 3C-like Protease (3CLPro). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to identify compounds that inhibit SARS-3CLpro-mediated peptide cleavage. In this assay, a fluorescent compound, HiLyte fluor TM 488, is attached at the N-terminus of a 3CLpro peptide substrate and is FRET quenched by a QXLTM520 moiety attached at the C-terminus. When the peptide is cleaved by SARS-3CLpro the fluorescent compound and quencher separate, leading to an increase in well fluorescence when measured at an excitation wavelength of 485nm and an emission wavelength of 535nm. As designed, compounds that inhibit 3CLpro activity will prevent cleavage of the labeled peptide substrate, thus leaving the fluorescent tag unquenched on the peptide, resulting in no increase in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 ul of 3CLpro enzyme (150 nM final concentration) in assay buffer (50mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton-X 100, 2 mM DTT) at pH 7.5 was dispensed into each well of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, 3CLpro inhibitor (300 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The assay was started by dispensing 1 ul of 3Clpro peptide substrate (2 uM final concentration) in 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 to each well. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 1 ul of 500 mM acetic acid was added to each well to terminate the assay and well fluorescence was read on a PerkinElmer Viewlux using fluorescein filters: excitation wavelength of 480 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 540 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth). The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control)/(MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing 3CLpro inhibitor. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 15 and active compounds range of activity score is 15 to 100.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the HepG2 cell line which is derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the HepG2 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Cell-membrane dose response assay to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of synthesized compounds to inhibit S1P1 activation by the physiologic agonist S1P.  In this assay, membranes from CHO cells stably expressing human S1P1 were used to measure S1P1 antagonism by test compound.  Membrane fractions prepared from these cells were incubated with test compounds in the presence of S1P and radiolabeled [35S]-GTP gamma S.  As designed, test compounds that inhibit binding of [35S]-GTP-gamma S to S1P1 in the membrane preparation will result in a decrease of measured radioactivity. These compounds are considered S1P1 antagonists. Protocol Summary: The protocol for this assay has been described previously [Ref 7]. CHO cells stably expressing the human S1P1 receptor (S1P1-CHO) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/ml of the antibiotic G418, 50 micrograms/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 micrograms/ml streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES. The cells were provided by D. Guerini (Novartis Pharma).   Prior to the start of the assay, cell membranes from S1P1-CHO cells were prepared as follows. Cells were dissociated in Enzyme-Free Cell Dissociation Media (Specialty Media), washed in cold PBS, suspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA (Buffer A) and 1# Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted on ice using a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer.  Following centrifugation at 75,000g for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C, the pellet was suspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA (Buffer B), and 1# Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and homogenized again. Membranes collected from centrifugation were suspended in Buffer B with 15% glycerol and stored at -80 degrees C until use in binding assays. Membranes (2 to 4 micrograms protein) prepared as described above were incubated in 96-well plates with test compounds diluted in DMSO.  Wells also contained 100 microliters of assay buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, and 5 micromolar GDP. The assay was started with the addition of 100 microliters of 250 pM [35S]-GTPgammaS (1250 Ci/mmol; NEN) in assay buffer.  Following a 60 minute incubation at room temperature, the membranes were harvested on GF/B filter plates using a Packard Filtermate Universal Harvester, and dried for 30 minutes. Next, 25 microliters of Microscint 20 was added to each well and the filter-bound radionuclide was measured using a Perkin Elmer 1450 MicroBeta.  The specific binding for replicate samples were averaged and expressed as the % response relative to activation by S1P alone (negative control).  For this assay Ki values are reported. All compounds have been assigned activity score of 100. List of reagents: Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03) HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080) Penicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-122) S1P (Biomol, part SL140-0001)

Description:  Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer, genetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor suppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is essential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer therapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search for homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step of HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and stimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. Our goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as chemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer therapies. DNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51 protein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this assay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides (47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm and the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with the sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the photon emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an increase in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the duplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA strand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this fluorescence. We have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI and their dose-response was carried out (AID 1435). 19 compounds showed a good dose-response. To confirm selectivity of these compounds a DNA binding assay was carried out to rule out the effect of DNA intercalation by these compounds. Compounds that show a negative result in the DNA binding assay can be taken to be Rad51 inhibitors and further confirmatory tests will be carried out. Here we report results of the DNA binding assay. Materials ds DNA was provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence assay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). Ethidium bromide and buffer salts were from Sigma. Assay Compound was incubated with Ethidium bromide and DNA. Displacement of Ethidium bromide by the compound (if any) was determined by Fluorescence on Envision (Exc: 535 nm; Emm: 595 nm) Dose response protocol 1.Serial dilute single compounds at in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop 3.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool 4. Add 4 ul ds DNA 5. Add 2 ul Ethidium bromide 6.Read fluorescence on Envision reader (Ex: 535 nm; Em: 595 nm) Data analysis IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (DMSO, no compound) in columns 1,2 and 23,24. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 85 uM to 2.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Additionally, compounds selected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation value (compared to AID 1032) in a set of experiments entitled,  "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by PPARgamma," (PubChem AID 631) and "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by PPARgamma" (PubChem AID 731). This assay tests the ability of test compounds to increase interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC2, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies.  As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2 protein [aa 624-829].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 micromolar final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 micromolar. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:      To screen for small molecular inhibitors that disrupt Smad protein-protein interactions, a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay was developed to measure the binding between Smad3 protein and the twenty-four amino acid FoxH1 Smad interaction motif (SIM) in a 384-well format. Smad3 with a 6xHis tag was indirectly labeled with a europium chelate through a europium conjugated anti-6XHis antibody. Peptide (FoxH1 SIM) was synthesized with an N-terminal Dy647 (MoBiTec) tag. Europium and Dy647 comprise a fluorescence energy transfer pair. Interaction of Smad3 protein with hFoxH1 peptide brings two conjugated fluorophores into proximity, leading to an energy transfer from europium to Dy647 and the generation of FRET signal. FRET signal is detected in an Analyst HT plate reader (Ex 340 nM, Em615 nM and Em665 nM) and expressed as FRET signal ratio (F665nm / F620nm * 104). The assay is robust with a consistent Z' factor of 0.6-0.8 in a 384-well plate format and is used for the screening of the NIH/DPI library of 86,106 compounds for Smad3/hFoxH1 inhibitors. 1. Assay buffer: K-Hepes, 50 mM, pH 7.0; KCl, 100 mM; BSA, 1mg/ml; DTT, 1mM; Tween 20, 0.2%. 2. Phosphorylated, 6xHis-tagged Smad3 protein: purified from an insect cell expression system 3. Dy647-hFoxH1 peptide: synthesized at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center and dissolved in DMF 4. Europium Chelate Anti-6xHis-Antibody: LANCE Eu-W1024 from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences 5. Positive control: unlabeled hFoxH1 peptide Procedure: 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant 6xHis-Smad3 protein (10 ng/well, final concentration) and Dy647-hFoxH1-peptide (300 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add 0.5 uL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 1hr. Final concentration of each compound in each well is 25 uM. 4. The FRET signal is recorded with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol - FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with Dy647-hFoxH1 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing 6xHis-Smad3 protein and Dy-647-hFoxH1 peptide that defines maximal FRET. 3. Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives. 4. Compounds were scored according to % inhibition, where 100 is the 100% inhibition and is the highest activity; 0 or less is inactive.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS screen for compounds effecting the binding of fluorscent GTP to various Ras-related GTPases yielded a number of interesting compounds.  In this assay the compound found to exhibit most specific response on Cdc42 protein was assessed in a dose response manner with different conditions than the primary screen.  For this assay, the nascent nucleotides were depleted from the protein prior to the measurement of binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of test compound in a 1 milliM MgCl2 buffer (the primary screen were carried out in 1 milliM EDTA buffer). The protein target (GST-Cdc42, 4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads is depleted of nascent nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA-containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% detergent, NP-40, containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM MgCl2, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA. Binding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or test compound (6 point 10-fold dilution series 100 nanoM to 10 microM) and subsequently adding 50 microL of a fixed concentration (1.5 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population. Non-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were assessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP (10 microM).  Calculations: The specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured at different test compound concentrations in the presense of blocking, non-fluorescent GTP (RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO): SpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP These specific binding values were normalize to the amount of binding in DMSO alone sample: %Response = 100*(SpecMCF/SpecMCFwDMSO) where SpecMCF is the specific binding of fluorescent GTP at different concentrations of test compound and SpecMCFwDMSO is the specific binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of DMSO alone.  The different %Response values were fit to 4-parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope: %Response= Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 +10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope)) where Bottom and Top are estimates of minimum and maximum of %Response over the concentration range of test compounds, LogEC50 is the log of the Effective Concentration of test compound yielding 50% change in the %Response, and HillSlope is variable slope of the dose response curve. PUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the estimated EC50 to the least amount of acceptable EC50, 10 microM. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = (10-EC50inMicroM)/10 where EC50inMicroM is the calculated estimate of EC50 in microM. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_SCORE greater than 50.

Description:  Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based dose response assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO-K1 cell line. The purpose of this artifact assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, , "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492964). Compounds tested in this assay were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO-K1 cell line" (AID 493232), are nonselective due to inhibition of Gq activity. This assay will determine dose response curves. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and parental CHO-K1 cells. In this assay, CHO-K1 cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of Gq activity. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Endogenous cellular IP1 production by the CHO-K1 cells will compete with labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that reduce Gq activity will reduce cellular IP1 production and also reduce the levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 66.2 uM. Protocol Summary: The parental CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of ATP agonist in DMSO ("EC Challenge"), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the Envision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1- ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing Assay buffer and DMSO. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 66.2 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 66.2 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 100-0. There are no active compounds.

Description:  Late-stage fluorescence-based dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3) counterscreen assay. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether powder samples of compounds identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107) were nonselective agonists as assayed by activation of S1P3. In this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 agonist will increase NFAT-BLA transcription and increase well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate (8,000 cells/well), followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.7 uM final nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.

Description:  Anesthetic development has remained a largely empirical process. There are growing concerns about the cognitive effects of known general anesthetics [1] and acceleration of the onset of neurodegenerative disease [2]. The compounds' toxicity [3] and multiple specific binding targets in the mammalian brain [4] has made them less attractive as drug leads. In this assay, a GABAergic mimetic model system, apoferritin and a profluorescent 1-aminoanthracene ligand (1-AMA), was used to construct a competitive binding assay for identification of novel general anesthetics. The assay was validated for 1-AMA using other known anesthetics, such as isoflurane (CID:3763) and propofol Three uL of reagents (free 1-AMA (50% saturated solution of 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 3, 4 as negative control and 1-AMA/apoferritin mixture (10 uM horse-spleen apoferritin in 50% saturated 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 1, 2, 5-48) was dispensed into 1536-well Greiner black assay plates. Compounds (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys pintool equipped with 1,536-pin array (10 nL slotted pins, V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA). Titration of the positive control, propofol, were delivered via pin transfer from separate control plates to the 2nd column of each assay plate. The starting concentration of the control, dissolved in DMSO, was at 160 mM, followed by two-fold dilution points in duplicate, for a total of 16 concentrations. The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on an EnVision HTS multilabel reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) (end point read, 3 min/plate) using Fura2 BFP excitation filter (380 nm, bandwidth 10 nm) and fluorescein emission filter (535 nm, bandwidth 25 nm) set. A LANCE/DELFIA dichroic mirror with a cutoff wavelength at 400 nm was used to maximize signal accuracy and strength. Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column 5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in order to monitor for and record any shifts in the background. Activity was computed as the normalized fluorescence response relative to free 1-AMA and 1-AMA/apoferritin complex values. Concentration-effect relationships were derived by using curve fitting algorithms developed in-house (http://ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts/). A four parameter Hill equation was fitted to the concentration-response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and observed responses.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (PubChem AID 1700). This cell-based reporter assay employs a human DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line that is stably transfected with a plasmid containing 2.0 kb of the human KLF5 promoter used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p). Cells are seeded in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for one day, followed by incubation with test compounds. Luciferase activity is monitored using a luminescent detection reagent, which contains the luciferase substrate D-luciferin that releases light energy upon conversion to oxyluciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and oxygen. As designed, compounds that inhibit KLF5 expression will reduce the activity of the KLF5 promoter, thereby reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and luciferase protein levels, resulting in decreased conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, and reduced well luminescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 4 micromolar. The DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 800 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 2500 cells in a 5 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above except without geneticin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or LY294002 (200 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 27 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-M1) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. M1-isoform: Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions . Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have RV less than 100. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound; PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. An active compound for RGS19 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 50 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:        To identify novel compounds that can act as effective ER-beta coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384 well format. This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-beta labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with LBD or ER-beta brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation. Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays. 1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-beta protein: Biotin-labeled ER-beta-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-Estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-beta protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plates. 3. Add 0.5 uL of library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. Final concentration of each compound in each well is 25.6 uM. 4. Record the FRET signal with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 620 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only, and FRETcontrol is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-beta protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. 3. Compounds that cause > 50% inhibition are defined as positives.

Description:  The 14-3-3 proteins are the prototype for a novel class of protein modules that can recognize phosphoserine/threonine (pS/T)-containing motifs in a variety of signaling proteins. To date, 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to bind more than 200 client proteins. Through these interactions, 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory processes, such as Bad-induced apoptosis, Raf-1-mediated cell proliferation, and Cdc25-regulated cell cycle progression. In addition to their participation in diverse physiological processes, 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in a number of clinically important pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Thus, such studies on the 14-3-3/client-protein interactions may provide tremendous opportunities for therapeutic interventions.  Therefore, chemical tools would allow pharmacological probing of 14-3-3 function under various conditions. To develop small-molecule modulators of 14-3-3 proteins, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP)-based 14-3-3 assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction of 14-3-3 with a fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide from Raf-1 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step "mix-and-measure" method was achieved for analyzing 14-3-3 proteins. This is a solution-based, versatile method that can be used to monitor the binding of 14-3-3 with a variety of client proteins. The 14-3-3 FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 384-well format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z' factor of above 0.7. Because of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for high-throughput screening of 14-3-3 modulators. The recombinant hexaHis-tagged 14-3-3gamma were expressed and purified as previously described. The peptide sequence containing phosphorylated S259 of Raf-1 was synthesized and labeled with 5/6 carboxytetramethylrhodamine. HEPES buffer (10mM, pH 7.4), NaCl (150mM), Tween-20 (0.05%), and DTT (0.5 mM) was used through the screening. The 14-3-3 FP assay was carried out in black 384-well uplates in a total volume of 50uL in each well. 49uL of assay reaction buffer (1uM of His-14-3-3gamma and 2nM of TMR-pS259-Raf peptide in HEPES buffer) were dispensed to 384-well black plate. For each assay plate, column 1, 2 and 23, 24 contain controls: TMRpS259-Raf peptide only (blank) and TMR-pS259-Raf peptide with His-14-3-3gamma (negative control); R18 peptide was added to wells with TMR-pS259-Raf peptide and His-14-3-3gamma and serve as positive control. Then 1ul of test compound (2 mM in DMSO) were added and the final compound concentration is 40uM (2% DMSO). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr and the fluorescence polarization value in millipolarization (mP) units was measured with an Analyst HT reader. An excitation filter at 545nm and an emission filter at 610 to 675nm were used with a dichroic mirror of 565 nm. Assay data was analyzed using Cambridgesoft. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by dividing mP (subtracting blank) value from compound wells by the average mP (subtracting blank) from negative controls (His-14-3-3gamma and peptide) in each plate and subtracted from 100. An activity cutoff was set as a percent inhibition greater than 30%.

Description:  Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to confirm PPARgamma/SRC1 activity of compounds identified as active in at least two of the following experiments: "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 631), "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 1032), and "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)"(PubChem AID 731). This assay tests the ability of compounds to modulate interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC1, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC1 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC1 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 ug/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (10 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately after addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following mathematical expressions: t15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. Data were evaluated using % Activation. Any compound that exhibited an average % Activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 16 compounds synthesized to explore structure activity relationship of SID 14723044, which was identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to measure p97 ATPase inhibition" (PubChem AID 1481), and confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the p97 ATPase" (PubChem AID 1517). The 16 synthesized compounds were tested in a previous assay entitled, "Luminescence dose response biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the p97 ATPase: synthesized compounds," (PubChem AID 1551). The target of the present assay is mutant Cys522Ala p97 protein and thus serves as a counterscreen for AID 1551. This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97Cys522Ala will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Prior to the start of the assay 18 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2, rows O and P of 384-well assay plates. The remaining wells were filled with 18 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM C522A p97 protein. Next, 50 nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 100 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 20 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 24 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and luminescence was measured by the Envision microplate reader.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in cathepsin B due to research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the Ebola and SARS viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin B inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin B is also implicated in cancer progression. Upregulation and secretion of this enzyme occurs in many types of tumors and correlates positively with their invasive and metastatic capabilities. Cathepsin B facilitates tumor invasion by dissolving extracellular barriers. Inhibitors of cathepsin B thus have been studied as potential anti-cancer agents. Two high-throughput screens against cathepsin B reported previously under AID 453 and AID 488 each independently revealed the same series of aminopyrazole inhibitors. Six compounds active in the original HTS were resynthesized, and 21 new compounds were made to explore SAR. As in the original HTS and IC50 follow-up, compounds were tested for inhibitory activity in an end-point assay that monitored the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. This assay is a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN). Materials Human liver cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219362). Substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1135.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium-potassium phosphate,  pH 6.8 (86 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, tribasic), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Assay Cathepsin B (0.065 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. Inhibitor IC50 values were determined as described below. IC50 protocol 1.Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.13 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening assay for activators of the nuclear receptor Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1). Nuclear receptors are a family of small molecule and hormone-regulated transcription factors that share conserved DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains. Small pharmacological compounds able to bind to the cleft of the ligand-binding domain could alter its conformation and subsequently modify transcription of target genes. Such ligand agonists and/or antagonists have already been successfully designed for 23 nuclear receptors among the 48 previously identified in the human genome. The nuclear receptor SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1) belongs to the class of "unexplored" orphan nuclear receptors that have been poorly investigated at a pharmacological level. SF-1 is expressed in the pituitary, testes, ovaries, and adrenal gland and regulates steroid hormone production at many levels, including direct regulation of expression of major P450 enzymes involved in steroid hormone synthesis. To explore the potential of SF-1 as novel drug target, small molecule ligands have to be identified. To this end, we screened the MLSCN library via a cell-based assay developed by Orphagen Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). Ligands for SF-1 may have clinical applications as modulators of adrenal steroid synthesis, and also as modulators of energy metabolism and obesity through the regulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The transcriptional cell-based assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the pFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear receptors. Compounds that enhance the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the increase of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential activators of the SF-1 nuclear receptor. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration.

Description:  Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands. The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET (time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer and the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating a TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The native unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding and reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled molecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be detected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was successfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format. Select compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency, efficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs of active compounds from the primary sceen. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200 cells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 uM RO-201724 (Sigma-Aldrich, B8279), 1.5% Alexa 647-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (from Perkin Elmer), 100 nM NPS) (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well detection reagent. Detection reagent was prepared by adding biotin labeled cAMP (4%), streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (1.33%) and TritonX-100 (1%) to detection buffer. Biotin labeled cAMP, streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate and detection buffer all came from the LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  The CMGC group of protein kinases which includes CDK-like kinases (Clk) and Dyks are essential kinases found in all eukaryotes. Clks have been implicated to play a role in the regulation of alternative splicing [1]; while Dyrks, in particular over expression of Dyrk1A, has been linked to diseases as Down syndrome (DS; OMIM 190685) [2] and Alzheimer disease (AD; OMIM 104300) [3].  Among the members of the CMGC group, the Clks and the Dyrks are very closely related [4] therefore to determine validity and selectivity of an active compound observed in the CLK4 qHTS screen (AID:1770), a bioluminescent counter-screen against Dyrk1A was developed. In addition, potent and selective compounds against Dyrk1A were identified to further assess the role of this enzyme in DS and AD. Dyrk1A (Invitrogen, cat # PV3785) was assayed using ATP and DYRKtide (AnaSpec, cat# 62698) as substrates. Promega Kinase-Glo  (cat# V6712) technology was used to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. The Kinase-Glo Plus contains Ultra-Glo [5] luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the remaining ATP. No enzyme and harmine (Sigma, cat # 286044-1G), a compound shown to inhibit Dyrks [6] were used as a positive control; while DMSO treatment was used as a negative control.  Two uL/well of substrate solution (8uM Dyrktide, 2uM ATP, 25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10mM MgCl2 , 0.5mM EGTA, 5mM cystein, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well assay plates (Greiner, solid white, medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD, Beckton-Dickenson). Compound solution (23 nL) was transferred to the assay plate using Kalypsys pin tool equipped with a 1536-pin tool. One uL/well enzyme solution (5nM Dyrk1A, 25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 10mM MgCl2, 0.5mM EGTA, 5mM cystein, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) was then added using FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 3uL/well.  After 2 hours of room temperature incubation, 3uL Kinase-Glo detection reagent was added for a final assay volume of 6uL/well.  The plates were spun for 30 seconds (1000 rpm) and incubated at ambient temperature for 2 minutes followed by a luminescence read using Perkin Elmer ViewLux plate reader at 3 seconds exposure time and 2x binning.

Description:  The purpose of this biochemical assay is to identify compounds that inhibit the refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase by Hsp90 protein (7, 8). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate is the source of Hsp90 protein. In this assay, denatured luciferase enzyme is incubated with the cell lysate in the presence of test compound. As designed, compounds that inhibit Hsp90 activity will prevent luciferase renaturation and activity, leading to a decrease in well luminescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.6 uM. Prior to the start of the assay, 3.75 ul of 8.3% rabbit reticulocyte lysate were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, geldanamycin (60 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1.25 ul of 6.29 ug/mL denatured luciferase solution containing 12 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 0.806 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase in Assay Buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 375 mM KCl) into all wells. After 3 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS were added to each well. Next, plates were incubated for 10 minutes and well luminescence was read on the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (test_compound - negative_control)/(positive_control - negative_control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, denatured luciferase, and cell lysate. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, denatured luciferase and cell lysate. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing geldanamycin, denatured luciferase, and cell lysate. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed Primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 16 and active compounds range of activity score is 16 to 100.

Description:  Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  This high-content imaging assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in a high-content screen for agonists of the GPR55 receptor, "Image-Based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55"(AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. The assay will identify small molecule antagonists of the GPR35 receptor.  This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further into coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) DMSO Working Solution: 100% DMSO 5) Agonist Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis #ALX-430-020-M010,10mg) 5mM stock in DMSO diluted to 100uM in PBS. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Agonist working solution (Zaprinast) was added to the entire plate except column 1 and 24 (DMSO only as positive non-inhibition control). Zaprinast final concentration was 10uM.  c. DMSO was added to column 1, 2 and 23, 24.  Final DMSO concentration was 0.31% d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm  mission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION - Threshold Adjustment:     4 - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   10 - Minimum Nuclear Area:    200 - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0 CYTOPLASM DETECTION - Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment: 0 - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.05 SPOT DETECTION - Spot Minimum Distance    3 - Spot Peak Radius     0 - Spot Reference Radius    3 - Spot Minimum Contrast    0.26 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   0.5 3) Metrics calculated from NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus") GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. IC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary high-throughput assay for chemical inhibitors of Rho kinase 2 (Rhok2) activity" were selected for testing in this assay. Out of 212 compounds identified during the primary screen, 206 compounds were assessed in this dose response experiment. Each compound was assayed in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 60 micromolar. As with the primary screen, the assay is based on ability of Rhok2 to phosphorylate a specific peptide sequence derived from its substrate - ribosomal protein S6 (amino acid residues 229-239). Rhok2 uses ATP as a donor of phosphate for the phosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay kit (Kinase-Glo, Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Using this kit, residual amounts of ATP are measured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, through which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to produce luminescence. Luminescent signal is directly proportional to ATP concentration and inversely proportional to Rhok2 activity. This dose response assay was conducted in 1536 well plate format. Each concentration was tested nominally in triplicate.

Description:  ER stress is a cellular response initiated by unfolded protein accumulation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Prolonged ER stress induces cell death with a form of apoptosis, and this cell death is related with various pathogenic pathways of disease like neurodegeneration, diabetes, vesicular disease etc. A series of benzodiazepine hits was originally identified in a HTS assay for inhibitors of ER stress-induced Cell Death (AID 1010) and confirmed in dose-response assay (AID 1247). Thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer, was used in both assays to trigger cell death in CSM14.1 cells. This assay was designed and performed in the laboratory of the assay provider to test if there is dose dependent inhibition of P38 MAPK phosphorylation by two of the benzodiazepine hits confirmed in AID 1247.  The CIDs were 2891837 and 2879344(SIDs 17485018 and 17465394.)  Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was determined using immunoblotting of treated CSM 14.1 cell extract.  p38 MAPK has been reported as an apoptotic transcription factor

Description:  The cytochrome P450 enzymes represent a diverse superfamily of hemoproteins present in eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaean systems. The primary function of these enzymes is in the metabolism and clearance of both endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds due to their propensity to metabolize multiple substrates through the catalysis of a range of reactions. CYP2C19 is an important enzyme in this superfamily in its ability to metabolize several important groups of drugs including antiepileptics and many proton-pump inhibitors. The assay was performed at Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics, part of MLSCN, as Library Characterization assay. In the assay, we tested the ability of compounds from MLSMR compound collection to inhibit the 2C19 conversion of the substrate luciferin-H EGE to luciferin EGE. 1) 2C19 enzyme - Human CYP2C19 + reductase + b5 Supersomes (BD Biosciences, cat #456259) 2) 2C19 substrate - Luciferin-H EGE (Promega) 3) Luciferin detection reagent (Promega) 4) Components of NADPH regeneration system were from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay was performed in 4-uL volume using 1536-well white plates (Greiner, 782075). Reaction was initiated by addition of solution of enzyme and luciferin substrate to the whole plate already containing compounds and NADPH regenerating system. Final concentrations of components in the assay were as follows: 1) 10 uM Luciferin-H EGE 2) 32 nM 2C19 enzyme 3) 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate 4) 3.3 mM magnesium chloride 5) 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 6) 0.4 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 7) 5 uM compounds (columns 5-48) 8) 2.5 mM tranylcypromine as a positive control (columns 1-2) 9) 0.5% DMSO (columns 1-48) Reaction was terminated after 30 min at room temperature by addition of 3 uL of reconstituted luciferin detection reagent. The plates were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Luminescent signal was measured on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the larger herpesvirus family that consists of three subfamilies. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an extremely prevalent human herpesvirus. Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that EBV infects, which are primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. Infection of both cell types is associated with a variety of proliferative disorders and cancers. Current treatments for such malignancies are traditional chemotherapy, radiation-therapy, surgery, and if possible, restoration of immune system function. Like all herpesviruses, EBV has mechanisms to evade the immune system and maintain latency in the human host. A treatment directed specifically against EBV could significantly improve patient care by limiting initial acute infection and spread of the virus between cells. Currently there are no inhibitors that block the entry of EBV. EBV gH and gL proteins form a heterodimeric complex and are required for membrane fusion with all known EBV-targeted cell types. gp42 is an EBV-encoded protein and is essential for EBV infection of B cells. In EBV, gH/gL forms a high affinity complex with gp42 prior to MHC class II binding and the activation of membrane fusion. In B cell fusion, gp42 binding to gH/gL is required for fusion activation. The central role of the EBV gH/gL protein in viral entry into both B cells and epithelial cells makes it an attractive target for the development of anti-viral inhibitors. To discover novel small molecule inhibitors of EBV induced membrane fusion and entry, which act by blocking essential viral protein interactions, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP) based assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction between the gH/gL protein with a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from gp42 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step mix-and-measure method was achieved for analyzing gH/gL protein and gp42 interaction. gH/gL protein FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 1536-well uHTS format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z### factor of above 0.7. Because of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for ultra high-throughput screening in 1536 well format of small molecules that bind directly to EBV gH/gL and block EBV entry. Positives from the primary screen, AID 1085, were selected for testing in this confirmatory assay. 1.Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2.gH/gL protein 3.gp42-36-81 peptide with an N-terminal fluorescein label (gp42-Flu) Procedure: 1.   Make assay reaction buffer for uHTS that contains gH/gL protein (2 nM, final concentration), gp42-Flu peptide (2 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 4.5 uL of assay reaction buffer to 1536-well black assay plate. 3. Add appropriate amount of compound to each well to reach assay concentration and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FP signals with an Envision Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. Data analysis: 1.FP signals are expressed as mP and recorded by Envision Multilabel plate reader. 2.Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FPcompound - FPpeptide only) / (FPcontrol -FPpeptide only)) * 100 Where FPcompound is the FP value from a well with a test compound, FPpeptide only is an average FP value from wells with gp42-Flu peptide only; FP value control is an average FP values from wells containing gH/gL protein and gp42-Flu peptide, which defines maximal FP signal. A 4 parameter logistic equation is fit to each compound using software from the R project for statistical analysis: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(conc/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom All of the fitted parameters are reported, as well as the relative IC50 (the point halfway between the fitted top and bottom of the curve), and the absolute IC50 (the point at which the dose response curve passes 50% activity). Compounds with an Absolute IC50 of <30 uM are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of Active. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is calculated by normalizing the observed range of absolute IC50s between 100 and 0, with the lowest IC50 corresponding to 100.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to act as potentiators or agonists of the NPY-Y2 receptor (Y2). A cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y2 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and therefore reduced probe fluorescence. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before a fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = (Median_Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (~EC25) and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Clk4 (Invitrogen, cat# PV3839) was assayed using ATP and the RS repeat peptide (AnaSpec cat # 61722) as substrates. In the assay, the ADP levels were detected using Promega ADP-Glo technology wherein the remaining ATP from the kinase reaction is first depleted with an ATPase reagent followed by a reagent that contains and enzyme which converts the ADP produced to ATP as well as Ultra-Glo luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the ATP. The positive control for the assay was TG003 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 300801-52-9) which has been described as an inhibitor of Clk 4[1]. Two uL/well of substrate-buffer solution (100 uM RS peptide, 1 uM ATP, 1x ADP-Glo Buffer A, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, final concentrations) was dispensed into 1536-well plates (Greiner, solid white, medium binding assay plates) with the Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD; Beckton-Dickenson). Twenty-three nanoliter of compound and control solutions were transferred to the assay plate using a Kalypsys pin-tool followed by 0.5 uL/well Clk4-buffer solution (25 nM Clk4, 1x ADP-Glo Buffer A, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 final concentration) dispensing for a total kinase reaction volume of 2.5 uL/ well. After 1 hr of room-temperature incubation, 2.5 uL ADP-Glo reagent was added and incubated at room temperature for 45 min to stop the kinetic reaction and degrade residual ATP. The ADP product was then converted to ATP by adding 5 uL per well of ADP-Glo Reagent II to yield a total assay volume of 10 uL/ well. Luminescence was detected after 30 min room temperature incubation with the Perkin Elmer Viewlux.

Description:  The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma is a transcription factor that has a central role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been implicated in graft versus host disease, autoimmune disease and asthma. ROR gamma is induced in naive T helper cells in the presence of TGF-beta combined with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23, and thereafter directs the expression of the Th17 lineage cytokines. To study the mechanism of action of ROR gamma, an insect cell-based assay was screened. This Drosophila Schneider cell line was stably transfected with two vectors: a gene expressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and ROR gamma transactivation domain under the control of the metallothionine promoter and a Photinus luciferase reporter regulated by the Gal4 binding site enhancer, UAS. The addition of copper to the medium induced expression of the Gal4-ROR gamma fusion that subsequently induced the UAS-luciferase reporter. Small molecule inhibitors of ROR gamma activity are detected by a decrease in luciferase reporter activity. For screening, 600 cells in 4 uL/well were dispensed into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature, and 1 uL/well copper sulfate (700 uM final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 20 hr at ambient temperature. After addition of 1.5 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play vital roles in numerous cellular processes and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases, ranging from cancer to cardiovascular, immunological, infectious, neurological, and metabolic diseases. The Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) PTP is a dual-specific Erk and Jnk phosphatase, the loss of which causes specific cell cycle arrest in HeLa carcinoma cells, suggesting that VHR inhibition may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer cells without detrimental effects on normal cells. Recent studies by collaborators and us suggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate phosphate from p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent. Chemical Library Screening.  A set of 50,000 drug-like molecules from the DIVERSet library (ChemBridge, Inc.) was screened in a 96-well format in vitro phosphatase assay.  Compounds had a working concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in 10% DMSO.  Each reaction contained 180 nM VHR, 4 mM pNPP, and 0.02 mg/mL compound in 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.0 reaction buffer with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) present.  The final volume amounted to 70 uL and contained 1.4% DMSO.  The reaction was initiated by addition of pNPP after a preincubation of the enzyme with compounds for 10 min at room temperature.  After 15 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 140 uL BIOMOL GREEN Reagent, and the pNPP hydrolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the complexed free phosphate at 620 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the negative control without addition of enzyme.  Other controls included a positive control (no inhibitor added), a background control (no substrate added), and a control with 200 uM of the general PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate.  To quantitate the inhibitory efficacy of the library compounds, we determined the ratio of inhibition in comparison to the positive control.  Every compound with >=60% inhibition was cherry-picked and rescreened using the same assay format.  Compounds that showed >=60% inhibition also in the confirmatory screen were regarded as hit.  A total of 221 hits were identified in the confirmation screen.

Description:  The cytochrome P450 enzymes represent a diverse superfamily of hemoproteins present in eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaean systems. The primary function of these enzymes is in the metabolism and clearance of both endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds due to their propensity to metabolize multiple substrates through the catalysis of a range of reactions. CYP2C9 is an important enzyme in this superfamily in its ability to metabolize a diverse range of substrates including non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and sulfonylureas. In this assay, we tested the ability of test compounds to inhibit the 2C9 conversion of the substrate luciferin-H to luciferin. The assay was performed at Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics, part of MLSCN, as Library Characterization Assay. In the assay, we tested the ability of compounds from MLSMR compound collection to inhibit the 2C9 conversion of the substrate luciferin-H EGE to luciferin EGE. 1)2C9 enzyme - Human CYP2C9 + reductase + b5 Supersomes (BD Biosciences, cat # 456258) 2)2C9 substrate - Luciferin-H (Promega) 3)Luciferin detection reagent (Promega) 4)Components of NADPH regeneration system were from Sigma-Aldrich.

Description:  Pimary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to confirm PPARgamma/SRC2 activity of compounds identified as active in at least two of the following experiments: "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 1032),"Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 631), and "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 731). This assay tests the ability of compounds to modulate interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC2, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate. Prior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2 protein [aa 624-829]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately after addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following mathematical expressions: t15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. Data were evaluated using % Activation. Any compound that exhibited an average % Activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral phenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the piperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring other heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with piperidine. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human delta opioid receptor (DOR). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in a uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the KOR receptor. This image-based DOR antagonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 1 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5 mM stock diluted to 5 uM in water. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Naloxone final concentration was 5 uM.  c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 6) SNC80 was added to the entire plate except column 23.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM. Plates were then incubated for another 45 minutes. 7) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  8) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 9) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 10) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 11) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml.

Description:  Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270). This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. The average percent inhibition and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary orexin 1 IP-One screen (AID 485270) was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-46, and for inactive compounds 46-0.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected using a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in 1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's software data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol: (1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The calcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. (3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 to 120 min. (4) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000. (5) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. (6) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. Record agonist response for 210 s. (7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM NPS). Record antagonist response for 140 s.

Description:  Dose response counterscreen for neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)," (PubChem AID 793).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 793;  2) they confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)" (AID 1257); and 3) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism (AID 1256)." A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 uM. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates.  Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing two microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (10 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T45 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  The concept of biased agonism [1] is an emerging concept of molecular pharmacology which proposes that seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), exist in multiple signaling conformations and complexes and that ligands (either agonists or antagonists) can induce signaling biased responses for distinct signal transduction cascades. Recently, this concept has been highlighted by beta-arrestin-biased signaling through 7TMRs [1]. beta-arrestins have been known to interact with agonist-occupied 7TMRs and thus to sterically inhibit coupling of the receptor to G proteins, leading to termination of signaling. Furthermore, accumulating evidence over the last decade has drawn attention to a novel function of beta-arrestins as signal transducers that scaffold various signaling molecules upon activation of 7TMRs. In particular, beta-arrestins have been shown to mediate activation of several signaling pathways upon stimulation of 7TM receptors even in the absence of G protein activation [2]. This beta-arrestin-biased signaling presumably leads to distinct physiological outcomes from those by G protein activation. Additionally, the active receptor conformations which prefer on this beta-arrestin signaling are likely different from those activating G protein signaling One of the systems in which biased agonism has been thoroughly elucidated is beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs), where the 'antagonist' ligand carvedilol has been demonstrated to selectively activate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways [3]. The goal of this screening project will be to discover and optimize novel beta-arrestin-biased ligands for beta2-AR signaling. A luminescent cell-based assay for beta2-AR-mediated agonism, known as the Tango assay [4], has been validated in which ligand binding of a recombinant beta2-AR and subsequent recruitment of a recombinant beta-arrestin lead to the release of the transcriptional activator tTA, which upregulates transcription of a tTA-responsive luciferase gene. Compounds with beta2-AR agonist activity lead to an increase in luciferase expression, and upon addition of a luciferase detection reagent, demonstrate an increase in luminescence. Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 46 microM to 0.6 nM. Tango cells were dispensed into white, solid, tissue-culture-treated 1536-well plates at 1500 cells/well in DMEM, containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 for 18 hr. Then 2.5 uL luminescent substrate mix (in-house prepared: 150 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM CoA, 0.15 mM ATP, 0.44 mM D-luciferin, final concentrations) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and subsequently measured on a ViewLux plate reader for luminescent signal using a clear filter with a 10 second exposure and 2x binning. The %Activity was determined from the corrected luminescence values. Isoproterenol, a well-characterized beta2-AR full agonist, and metaproterenol, a less potent beta2-AR agonist, were included both in 16-pt titration and at full response concentration to normalize %Activity of identified agonists; DMSO-pinned controls were used to normalize 0%Activity (zero agonism), while EC100 isoproterenol and/or EC100 metaproterenol were used to normalize 100%Activity (full agonism). Concentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the resulting luminescence. The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity, and compounds were subsequently categorized based on their curve class. Active agonists showed concentration-dependent increases in luminescence, concordant with an increase in bound beta2-AR and luciferase expression. Inactive compounds showed no effect on luminescence signal.

Description:  Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor  Agonists A confirmatory assay of putative TSHR agonists was conducted on a different TSHR transfected HEK 293 cell line, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: antibody-based Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF). Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) cAMP Assay.  HEK 293 cells stably transfected with a vector containing the TSHR and maintained under hygromycin selection were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Marvin Gershengorn. Compounds were assayed using a HTRF cAMP detection kit (Cisbio) on the TSHR transfected cell line. Briefly, 750 cells were plated in 2.5 ul/well of complete media (DMEM containing 10 % FCS, and 100 uM RO 20-1724) in 1536 well solid bottom white plates and 23 nl/well compound in DMSO solution or controls was added. Following 30 minute incubation at room temperature, 2.5 ul/well of labeled d2 cAMP and 2.5 ul/well of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1:20 in lysis buffer) were added to each well using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora Discovery, San Diego) . Plates were measured using the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) with excitation at 330 nm and emissions of 615 nm and 660 nm.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. Recent interest in cathepsin L has been generated by research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the SARS and Ebola viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin L inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that appear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion. A high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors was designed as an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Primary HTS results and dose-response confirmation in the presence of DTT and cysteine have been reported previously (AIDs 460 and 825). A compound with picomolar activity against cathepsin L was designed by molecular modeling as a modification of a previous compound, synthesized, and the kinetics of inhibition were determined. Activity of this novel chemical probe is reported here. Human liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM cysteine. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Assay Cathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1. Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2. Fill Corning low-volume 384-well black plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4. Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205. (Four parameter logistic fit; maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively; Hill slope limited to > -0.1.)

Description:  The purpose of this counterscreen assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)" (AID 1789), were nonselective due to inhibition of native luciferase activity. In this biochemical assay, native luciferase is incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit native luciferase activity will decrease well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.9 micromolar. Prior to the start of the assay, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 5.0 microliters of 0.026 micrograms/mL native luciferase solution containing 3 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase in Assay Buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, 375 mM KCl) into all wells. 30nL of test compounds were added to appropriate wells. After 10 minutes of incubation at RT 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS were added to each well. Next, plates were incubated for 10 minutes and well luminescence was read on the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the MRC5 cell line which is derived from normal human lung fibroblasts. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the MRC5 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Pyruvate kinase (partially purified from Bacillus stearothermophilus) was assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate.  ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for inhibitors and activators.  In addition, ribose 5 phosphate, a positive modulator of pyruvate kinase, was included in the assay at AC10 in order to identify possible potentiators. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 2 mM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.7 nM ribose 5 phosphate, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration, 10 nM pyruvate kinase, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for less than a minute, plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Three uL of detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Cambrex) was added, the plates centrifuged, and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 5 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the controls for AC100 stimulation (5 uM ribose 5 phosphate) and to AC100 inhibition (110 uM luteolin).

Description:  A modified strain of Vibrio harveyi with constitutive on quorum sensing system will be exposed to small molecules identified from the HTS screen used to identify LuxS inhibitors and LuxPQ antagonists. Growth of the organism post exposure will be followed using optical density and disruption of down stream quorum sensing elements will be observed  based on decreased luminescent signal. Expected Outcome: Identification of AI-2 quorum sensing system inhibitors with modes of action which either antagonize the LuxPQ receptor or inhibit LuxS synthase.  Such inhibitors should not perturb growth (observed by optical density) nor the constitutive on quorum sensing (observed by luminescence).

Description:  Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary Screen was declared active.

Description:  Potentiation of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1-luciferase construct.  In this primary assay approximately 195,000 test compounds from the MLSCN library were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds from the MLSCN library, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma.  Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 potentiator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing luminescence.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M2 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M2-expressing CHO cells as described. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 ul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less. Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (hPK-M2)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-M2 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH  Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-M2 and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes. Data were normalized to the basal signal.

Description:  TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to confirm activity of the top 2,500 most active compounds identified in a previous set of experiments entitled, "TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 1899). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies, blocking the transfer of energy from Europium to XL-665, and thus inhibiting well FRET. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nm, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as assay wells treated with test compound. Negative_Control is defined as assay wells treated with DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as assay wells treated with 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein. Any compound that exhibited a percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. % Inhibition values greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-51, for inactive 51-0.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that potentiate KCNQ2 potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium (K) channels are critical for neuronal function in excitable tissues such as brain and heart. They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such as hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human genome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified by the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of bioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal of insights into the structure and function. The KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are members of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels commonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are regulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily expressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital long QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are within the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9]. In the mid-90s, a compound known as D-23129, or retigabine, was initially developed to target GABAnergic signaling [10, 11].  Despite its poor effect on the GABA pathway, retigabine was shown to have potent anti-convulsant activity. In 1997, retigabine was also found to induce the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels at resting membrane potentials, and since then, through a variety of other studies, this has been established to be its main mechanism of action. Retigabine, acting on KCNQ2/3 potassium channels which code M-currents, is now being used for treatment of epilepsy.  None of the anti-convulsants that are in clinical use today have a comparable mechanism of action, i.e., through ligand activation of voltage-gated potassium channels.  Several potentiation compounds are synthesized according to the scaffold of retigabine. However, considering the poor potency of retigabine and several other undesirable characteristics including its broad action on KCNQ2, 3, 4, and 5 [12], it is not clear whether these related structures will fundamentally improve therapeutic efficacy.  Hence, it argues for the performance of a non-biased screen for new structures with potentiation activity. Systemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of molecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular target of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens specifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large compound library. Principle of the assay The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [13]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [14, 15].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of KCNQ2 is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that potentiate KCNQ2 potassium channels. This assay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were measured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit. Those CHO-K1 cells stably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed by the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a potentiator of the KCNQ2 channel. Protocol for the KCNQ2 project: 1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul/well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells. 5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness. 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on the Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), ICmax of ZTZ240  (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds). 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system. 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in darkness. 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4. 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline. 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds. 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0. 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive. controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [16]. 16. Calculate B scores [17] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (>=3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 3 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) potentiator of the KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of INT(100*LOG(B Score Potentiator Ratio), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B Score Potentiator Ratio), B Score Potentiator Ratio, as in the result definition.

Description:  Counterscreen for S1P2 Agonists: Dose Response High Throughput Cell-Based Screen to Identify Activators of CRE-BLA: S1P2 Purchased Analogues A cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure activation of the CRE pathway. Under normal conditions, the cells have low CRE basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels.  Stimulation of the CRE pathway by an agonist induces transcription of the BLA gene in proportion to agonist concentration, resulting in increased BLA activity. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity.  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul(100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension were dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to the sample or control wells, respectively.   Next, 1.1 ul of forskolin were dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 2 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of PBS was dispensed into negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: Percent Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)] Where: Well ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength. Negative control wells are defined as wells containing DMSO Positive control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in greater than 50 percent activation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 value was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 values less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent activation is observed. This calculation results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-014) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. qHTS protocol for CellTiter Glo lymphoblastoid cellular assay

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound potentiation of an EC20 dopamine response by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Formyl peptide receptors. The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the originating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily. The present assay was undertaken to identify which of the 5 test compounds active in dose-response assays were FPRL1 antagonists. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent the rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPRL1 peptide agonist, WKYMVm. The assay was performed in low throughput mode in a plate reader. RBL cells expressing human FPRL1 were resuspended in warm tissue culture medium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 1.6 microM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After incubation, Fluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB medium (110 milliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) human serum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, and stored on ice.  100 microL of Fluo-4 labeled cell suspension plus 1 microL of test compound was added to wells of a Nunc 96-well plate (Nunclon surface, Nuncbrand, Denmark) and allowed to warm at 37 degrees C for 5-10 minutes. Final test compound concentration was 100 microM (1% DMSO) unless otherwise indicated.  Wells were then sequentially analyzed in a PerkinElmer Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter used in bottom counting mode with excitation at 485 nm and emission detected at 535 nm. For each well there was an initial 10 s reading at 1 second intervals to establish background fluorescence intensity, then 100 microL of 10^-9 M WKYMVm was dispensed into the well, the plate was shaken for 5 seconds and readings were made for an additional 30 seconds thereafter at 1 second intervals. The fluorescence intensity (FI) values were summed and averaged for the 10 seconds prior to stimulus addition (Avg_FI_Base). The FI values were summed over the 30 measurements made during the last 30 seconds post-addition to determine the area under the response curve post-addition (AUC_Post). Avg_FI_Base was multiplied by 30 to obtain a baseline area under the curve estimate (AUC_Base). The response to stimulus was calculated as the difference: AUC_Response = AUC_Post - AUC_Base AUC_Response was calculated for 2 conditions: 1) no test compound present and WKYMVm added as stimulus (Rmax), and 2) test compound present and WKYMVm added as stimulus (Rtest). Test compound inhibition of the calcium response was calculated as:   % Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (Rtest/Rmax)] Activity Scoring Test compounds resulting in greater than 70% inhibition were considered active antagonists. The activity score was calculated for active test compounds as follows: Activity Score = 100 x (Inhib_Test - Inhib_Min)/(Inhib_Max - Inhib_Min) in which Inhib_Test was inhibition mediated by the test compound, Inhib_Min was 70 (the threshold for an active test compound), and Inhib_Max was the maximum inhibition observed for all test compounds. Compounds resulting in 70% inhibition or less were assigned an activity score of 0.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. The dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in the uHTS luminescent, beta-arrestin assay for antagonists of the KOR receptor 1) OPRK1 beta-Arrestin (DiscoveRx) 2) Assay Medium: Opti-MEM Medium supplemented with 1% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) 3) Growth Medium: MEM supplemented with 10% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) uHTS protocol: Day 1 1) Harvest cells using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen Cat#13151-14).

Description:  To aid in the interpretation of high-throughput screening (HTS) results derived from luciferase-based assays, we used quantitative HTS, an approach that defines the concentration-response behavior of each library sample, to profile the ATP-dependent luciferase from Photinus pyralis against more than 72 000 samples. Luciferase (PKLight, Cambrex Corporation) was assayed for its ability to generate light using ATP and luciferin as substrates. The ATP concentration in the assay (10 uM) was within the linear range of enzyme activity for the assay conditions used.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS and either 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Cys (Aldrich cat# 861677), or 10mM DTT and 50 units/well catalase (from bovine liver, Sigma cat#100)) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  A cell-sensor assay for I-kappa-B-alpha stabilization was developed. The assay uses green (CBG68) and red (CBR) emitting beetle luciferases [Chroma-Glo(TM) developed by Promega Corp.] where the green luciferase is fused to I-kappa-B-alpha  and the red luciferase is present in its native state. Both luciferase genes are stably present in the OCI-Ly3 human ABC DLBCL cell line, but their expression is under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoters. Following the addition of doxycycline to induce expression of the luciferases, the green luminescence in control cultures rises only slowly because the CBG fusion partner I-kappa-B-alpha is targeted by IKK activity for rapid degradation. In contrast, green luminescence rises rapidly in the presence of proteasome inhibitors or IKK inhibitors. The rise in red luminescence of CBR is not affected by proteasome or IKK inhibitors, and serves as normalization for cell number and nonspecific effects. Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 57 uM to 0.7 nM.

The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat-inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 % charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Next, 10 microliters of cell suspension (10,000 cells) were dispensed into each well and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO2.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone to sample or negative control wells, respectively. Next, 1.1 microliters of S1P (1 micromolar final nominal concentration) in 2 % fatty acid-free BSA were dispensed to positive control wells. Then, 1.1 microliters of 2 % fatty acid-free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test compound wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO2 for 4 hours. Next, 2.2 microliters/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Values from each channel were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength Percent activation was then calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = 100 *(Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_Negative_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Positive_Control # Median_Ratio_Negative_Control) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Negative_Control is defined as wells containing BSA Positive_Control is defined as wells containing S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 micromolar) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 micromolar.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 micromolar and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 micromolar. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases. Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral phenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the piperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring other heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with piperidine. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase reticulocyte (hPK-R) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-R and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes. Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  To identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERbeta, a competitive binding approach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This assay measures the ability of small molecules with unknown ERbeta binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERbeta in permeabilized whole cells expressing ERbeta-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind ERbeta will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with ERbeta-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructrions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Columns 3-22 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Primary screening was completed at 10 microM as well as 100 nanoM to identify a select number of relatively potent primary hits. Calculations: Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen) wells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells. Compounds were considered "Active" if they inhibited more than 70% of binding at 10 microM or 65% of binding at 100 nanoM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives." The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding compared with activity cutoff (i.e., 70% for 10 microM and 65% for 100 nanoM). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff (i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity cutoff: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff) where Cutoff was 70% for 10 microM and 65% for 100 nanoM and %Inhibition was the maximum %inhibition above the Cutoff between 10 microM and 100 nanoM experiments. The %Inhibition was calculated by: %Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF) where Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was the average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells (i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 1267). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871 and AID 1267; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation"(AID 932); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB activation" (AID 1309); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 1318). In this assay STAT3 activation was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 activator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus increasing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The activator and inhibitor dose response assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 ug/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into all wells. The plates were then incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Fluorescence dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). The purpose of this assay is to dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1510) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (AID 1524). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. All compounds in this assay are active and range of activity score is 0 to 100.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1778) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Assay materials: 1) OPRK1 beta-Arrestin (DiscoveRx) 2) Assay Medium: Opti-MEM Medium supplemented with 1% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) 3) Growth Medium: MEM supplemented with 10% hiFBS, 1X Pen/Strep/Glu, 125 ug/mL Hygromycin (1/2 recommended), 250 ug/mL Geneticin (1/2 recommended) Day 1 1) Harvest cells using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen Cat#13151-14). Add 500 cells/well in 5 uL of media to each well of a white, 1536 well plate. 2) Spin cells at 500 rpm for 1 min, then wrap plates in Saran Wrap. 3) Incubate overnight at 37C with 5% CO2. Day 2 1) Using a Labcyte Echo, DMSO and test compounds are transferred to wells. DMSO only is transferred to columns 1-3 and 46-48(Control wells), while varying volumes of test compounds are transferred to columns 4-45 to achieve the desired test concentrations. Test compound wells in the assay plate are back-filled with DMSO to equalize final assay concentrations. 2) Immediately following Echo transfer, 1.0 uL of assay media is added to columns 1-45 and 1.0 uL of assay media containing 6 uM dynorphin A is added to columns 46-48 for a final assay concentration of 1.0 uM. Centrifuge plates at 500 rpm for 1 min immediately following additions. 3) Incubate for 1hr and 30 minutes. 4) During test incubation, prepare Detection Reagent Solution from DiscoveRx (1 part Galacton Star: 5 parts Emerald II and 19 parts Cell Assay Buffer) 5) Add 2.5ul of detection reagent solution to each well. 6) Incubate at room temperature for 60 min in the dark 7) Read plates in a Perkin Elmer Envision using a luminescence protocol

Description:  In the present assay, we pre-treated MRP-1 overexpressing human H69AR lung tumor cells with library compounds for 18-22 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM prior to the addition of a 10 point 2-fold dilution series of doxorubicin, a known MRP-1 substrate, ranging from 0.195 uM to 100 uM. Following 72 hours of combined treatment, viable cell number was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of vehicle treated cells which served as positive controls, and 32 replicates treated with doxorubicin (25 uM), which served as negative controls.

Description:  Luminescence-based confirmation cell-based assay for cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line. The purpose of this assay is to confirm IEC-6 cell cytotoxicity of compounds tested in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for KLF5 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line," (PubChem AID 1825). In this assay, non-transformed rat IEC-6 epithelial cells are incubated with tests compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega) to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  A homogeneous coactivator assay able to measure interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-1 using Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) readout has been developed. This assay is based on the efficient Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC1 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by the fluorophore-labeled antibodies, anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands that promote the association of the SRC-1 coactivator with the fusion protein will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies in the complex. Therefore, agonist activity is detected as an increase in fluorescence at the acceptor emission wavelength. The assay was run in black solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates. Five microliters of HTRF assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride (Sigma, part#449148-25G), 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS (Sigma, part# C5070-5G), 100mM Sodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part# 71505), 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma, part# A3294-10G), pH7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed column 1-2 of the plate. The remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of HTRF assay buffer supplemented with 106 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK (CisBio, part#61GSTKLB), 2 ug/mL of anti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part# AD0059F), 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part# P4036) and 40 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 627-786] (produced by Dr. Swati Prasad, The Scripps Research Institute, FL). Microplates were then centrifuged for 30s at 300g to allow buffer to sit uniformly at the bottom of each well. Forty nanoliters of controls or test compounds (8 micromolar final nominal concentration, 0.8% final DMSO concentration) were then distributed to each well. Plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius. After this incubation time, microplates were allowed to equilibrate 30 minutes at room temperature before being centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. After excitation at 340 nm, wells fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This image-based fluorescent beta-arrestin assay was performed to confirm hits originally identified in the uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for antagonists of the KOR receptor. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Agonist Working Solution: Dynorphin (American Peptide #24-4-50, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 50uM.  5) DMSO Control Working Solution: 3.1% DMSO in water 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Dose Response Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 500nM to 32uM (seven doses), in duplicate. b. DMSO Control working solution was added to column 1 & 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.3%. c. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. After 30 minutes, agonist working solution (Dynorphin) was added to the entire plate, except column 1 (representing the positive control).  Dynorphin final concentration was 50nM.  Plates were again incubated for 45 minutes. 6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1)   Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: 40x 0.6 NA air objective Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emisssion filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm. 3)  For the dose response hit confirmation, compounds with an IC50 of <10uM were considered "confirmed actives". IC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  To measure 5-HT1E agonism, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was developed at the Scripps Molecular Research Institute Screening center. This line contained the human 5-HT1E receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15), and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter. When cells were agonized with a 5HT1E agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 6 micromolar final concentration. The results of the potency assay will be published in a future submission. The CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml (Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The HTS assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 30 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added. The selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 was also added (30nL) to positive control wells to a final concentration of one micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added to all wells. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, plate fluorescence was measured with the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS19 that value had been determined to be 107 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-006) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for drug discovery. The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)-protein family has important roles in GPCR signal transduction. RGS proteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signaling regulatory elements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signaling; however, some also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS inhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional specificity. The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated distributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system disorders. Inhibitors of the RGS:GPCR interaction should prove useful as small molecule tools in this research field. A complex of Gai1 and fluorescently labeled G-alpha-binding peptide (the "GoLoco motif") derived from RGS12 is incubated with library members. Inhibitors of the binding are detected by a decrease in the fluorescence polarization (FP) of the fluorophore. Protein was supplied by Prof. David Siderovski, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Assay Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM GDP (prepared fresh), and 0.05% NP40 at pH 7.5. Controls: 15 nM Rhodamine labeled peptide dispensed into columns 3 and 4 to generate negative control (full inhibition of binding, -100 % activity). 15 nM Rhodamine labeled peptide/25 nM protein in columns 1, 2, 5 - 48. Titration of unlabeled peptide control ([H]TMGEEDFFDLLAKSQSKRMDDQRVDLAG[NH2], custom synthesized and HPLC-purified by Tufts University Core Facility) from 20 mM, then 1:2 dilution, 16-point in duplicate, pin-transferred to column 2, rows 1 to 32. Column 1 is neutral. Rhodamine-labeled peptide (Rhodamine-DEAEEFFELISKAQSNRADDQRGLLRKEDLVLPEFLR-NH2) was custom-synthesized and HPLC-purified by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Assay Steps. Four uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid-bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager using BODIPY for the rhodamine-labeled decapeptide probe. During dispense, reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath and all liquid lines were covered with aluminum foil to minimize probe and protein degradation. All screening operations were performed on a Kalypsys robotic system (Kalypsys, Inc., San Diego, CA) containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 anthropomorphic robotic arms.

Description:  Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland which belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a seven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s) protein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and regulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with thyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after surgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small molecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and physiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small molecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has ever been reported. In order to confirm specificity of the compounds to the TSHR, a  confirmatory assay was conducted on a similar family member, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) receptor, transfected into a HEK 293 cell line, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: antibody-based Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF). This line did not contain the CNG and was therefore incapable of being used in the primary assay format. Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) cAMP Assay. HEK 293 cells stably transfected with a vector containing the FSH receptor and maintained under hygromycin selection were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Marvin Gershengorn. Compounds were assayed using a HTRF cAMP detection kit (Cisbio) on the FSH receptor transfected cell line. Briefly, 750 cells were plated in 2.5 ul/well of complete media (DMEM containing 10 % FCS, and 100 uM RO 20-1724) in 1536 well solid bottom white plates and 23 nl/well compound in DMSO solution or controls was added. Following 30 minute incubation at room temperature, 2.5 ul/well of labeled d2 cAMP and 2.5 ul/well of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1:20 in lysis buffer) were added to each well using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora Discovery, San Diego) . Plates were measured using the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) with excitation at 330 nm and emissions of 615 nm and 660 nm.

Description:  Dose-response biochemical assay for inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity Forty-six compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity" (PubChem AID = 570) have been assessed in this dose response experiment. As with the primary screen, this assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave a fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which has been modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site recognized by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens.  The fTHP is labeled with both a (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl fluorophore (Mca) and a 2,4-dinitrophenyl quencher (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in liberation of Mca fluorescence. In this assay, the fluorescence signal from unquenched Mca is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. The dose-response assay was conducted in 1536 well plate format. Each compound was assayed in triplicate, using 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 39.8 micromolar. This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate in Assay Buffer (50 millimolar Tris-HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively), were added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in Assay Buffer (same composition as above). After 4 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celcius, 5 microliters of 50 millimolar EDTA was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius and emission fluorescence was read on the Perkin-Elmer Viewlux microplate reader (excitation = 325nm, emission = 450nm). The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (I450_test_compound -median_I450_negative_control)/(median_I450_positive_control - median_I450_negative_control)*100 Where: I450 represents the fluorescence intensity read at 450nm during an excitation at 325nm; Positive_control is test wells that contain 8 micromolar MMP13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) Negative_control is test wells that contain DMSO only For each compound, percentage inhibitions were plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% inhibition level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 39.8 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 39.8 micromolar. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 of equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. List of reagents: MMP13 enzyme (R&D Systems cat# 511-MM-010, Minneapolis, MN) MMP13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) MMP13 inhibitor (Calbiochem cat# 444283) EDTA Disodium salt solution 0.5M (Sigma-Aldrich cat# E7889-100mL) Brij35 30% solution (Sigma-Aldrich cat# B4184-100mL) NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich cat# S3014-500g) CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich cat# C8106-500g) Tris-HCl (Fluka cat# 93363-100g)

Description:  Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "Primary Cell-based High Throughput Screening assay for inhibitors of the nuclear receptor Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1)" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information on the primary screen can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID=525. Three hundred and fifty nine (359) compounds selected during the primary screening were assessed in dose-response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. As with the primary screen, the dose-response assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the pFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential inhibitors of the SF-1 nuclear receptor.

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M5  were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). For compounds with an average EC50 greater than 30uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '0'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 30uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. The 'Score' for compounds with average EC50s greater than or equal to 1uM was assigned as '50' and for less than 1uM as '100'.

Description:  Injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity after the prolonged seizures termed status epilepticus (SE). Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) activation by ischemia and SE generally contributes to neuronal injury, but multiple downstream COX2 signaling pathways, and our data, suggest that the mechanisms promoting and opposing brain injury are complex. Value of allosteric prostanoid receptor modulators. Given the broad roles of COX2 in inflammation and neurodegeneration, and the recognition that interrupting the entire signaling cascade with a COX2 blocker prevents generation of protective as well as harmful prostanoids, it is surprising that there have not been larger advances in the development of agents that selectively target different prostanoid receptors. Merck has had some success in development of EP1, EP3 and DP1 antagonists. However, only one selective agonist for EP2 is known (butaprost), and there are no selective EP2 or DP2 antagonists available. An approach to developing highly selective compounds that has been very successful for ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors is to search for allosteric regulators of receptor function. Allosteric modulators provide spatial and temporal context dependence because they only affect receptor activation in the presence of the agonist. This is an important feature for our purpose because the endogenous prostanoids are typically released in a pulsatile fashion in response to a stimulus. Allosteric regulators typically bind to a site on the receptor different from the agonist binding site and so do not target the typically highly conserved agonist binding pocket. Allosteric regulators are also insensitive to the concentration of agonist and therefore are effective even in the presence of the high concentrations of released prostaglandins expected during and after seizures. Finally, allosteric modulators used as therapeutics provide an additional level of safety in cases of overdose because their response typically saturates. EP2 is a Gs-coupled GPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP. We created a rat C6 glioma cell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under control of the CMV promoter. Thirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM butaprost (a selective EP2 agonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to cause cAMP accumulation in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The subclone chosen for further study responded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from 0.057 to 58 fmoles / 6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to butaprost or the endogenous ligand, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (not shown). The primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a cAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF assay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with butaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, reduces the FRET signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was carried out for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for manipulating cell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12 hours after lysing the cells. A cell density of 6000 to 9000 cells/well in a 384-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics, with Z' >0.75 and S:N > 15. The assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is approximately 7-fold more potent than butaprost, and will be used in HTS because the action of allosteric modulators is frequently influenced by the agonist chosen. Positives from the primary screen, AID 940, were chosen for testing in this confirmatory dose-response assay. Reagents: Cell culture medium: 500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen Strept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml Geneticin Procedure: 1. Grow cells: Cells were grown over a week in T-175 flasks and split when appropriate to reach the final volume of 40-50 T-175 flasks necessary for screening. 2. Harvest cells: 1. Aspirate medium from T-175 flasks, rinse with HBSS without Ca-Mg. 2. Add 3 ml /flask Versene (EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml) (BioWhittaker Cat# 17-711E) 3. Tap flasks vigorously 4. Add 10 ml/flask HBSS (+Ca+Mg) and combine the cells in 4 centrifuge tubes (50ml) 5. Centrifuge cells at 800g for 8 min 6. Discard supernatant 7. Resuspend cells in about 100 ml HBSS(+Ca+Mg) 8. Count cell number 3. Cell density optimization Make dilutions of PGE2 in HBSS to arrive at testing concentrations of PGE2. Make dilutions of cells to arrive at testing concentrations of cells. Add 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9 in HBSS) and incubate at RT for 10 - 40 min Add 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1:18), centrifuge plate and incubate at RT for 20min to 2 hr Read FRET signal using Envision (100us delay) Analyze data and calculate the EC50s at different cell density Choose cell density for screening (EC50 of PGE2 is 1 - 3 nM) 4. Screening Step 1: make 250 ml of cells (for 40 1536-well plates), add 250 ul of 10 mM Rolipram Step 2: dispense 4 ul of cells to column 3 - 46 Step 3: dispense 1 ul of HBSS to column 3 - 4 Step 4: add compound using Pin-tool (Beckman NX) Step 5: add 1 ul of 6 uM PGE2 to PGE2 control wells. Step 6: add 1 ul of 120 uM Forskolin to forskolin control wells (final 20 uM) Step 7: dispense 1 ul of d2-conjugate (1:9) to column 4 Step 8: make mixture of d2-conjugate and PGE2: Step 9: dispense 2 ul of d2-conjugate and PGE2 mixture to column 5 - 46 step 10: shake plates well, centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10min, incubate at RT for around 10mins (no longer that 20 min) Step 11: dispense 2 ul of anti-cAMP Europium conjugate (1: 18 dilution in lysis buffer) to column 3 - 46 Step 12: shake plates well, centrifuge plates at 1500g for 10 min and incubate at RT for 10 min. Put plates in 4C refrigerator before reading Step 13: Read plates using Envision with Twister II robot. Run 5 plates/batch from refrigerator. 5. Data analysis: Data analysis: 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 10000 F665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps) F620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps) 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate. Normalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET blank(compound added)) / ((FRET compound well - FRET background) (no compound added)) % of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from control wells) * 100 % of inhibition = 100 - % of activity Where FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an average FRET ratio from wells with cells, Anti-cAMP-Eu and HBSS buffer only; FRET control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing 0.3 nM PGE2 that defines maximum FRET signal. Percent induction is then calculated based on a comparison with wells containing 1 uM PGE2: % induction = (Pct Inhibition Compound / Pct Inhibition 1 uM PGE2) * 100 8 different concentrations of PGE2 were tested, and 3 different compound concentrations were applied to each 8-concentration set of PGE2 curves, to assess the impact of each compound on the PGE2 dose-curve. A 4 parameter logistic equation is fit to the PGE2 curves using software from the R project for statistical analysis: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(conc/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom Dose response curves were obtained for PGE2 at 0 uM compound concentration and at 6.7 uM and 20 uM compound concentration. The PGE2 EC50s at 0, 6.7 and 20 uM compound concentrations were compared to see if each assayed compound caused a significant shift in the PGE2 EC50.  After visual inspection of the curves, an empirical formula was determined to mark active compounds.  Compounds were marked as Active if: PGE2 EC50 @ 20 uM > 0.05 PGE2 EC50 @ 20 uM < 0.31 Curve Slope  @ 20 uM > -1.5 Curve Slope @ 20 uM < 0.5 Curve Bottom @ 20 uM < 40 Compounds which were marked as Active were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100.  Inactive compounds were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. The field "Active Concentration" was set to 20 uM for active compounds.

Description:  The assay was designed to pre-treat MRP-1 overexpressing human H69AR lung tumor cells with library compounds for 18-22 hours at a final concentration of 10 micromolar prior to the addition of a toxic dose of doxorubicin (IC80 = 25 uM), a known MRP-1 substrate. Following 72 hours of combined treatment, viable cell number was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of vehicle treated cells which served as positive controls, and 32 replicates treated with doxorubicin (25 micromolar), which served as negative controls.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-003) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 7 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 7 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-DEVD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4). Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as agonists of S1P4. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 5 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation =100* (1-((Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5&#956;M S1P A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 2 and active compounds range of activity score is 2 to 100. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the primary kidney proximal tubule cells freshly isolated from rat. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the rat kidney proximal tubule cells with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of SFLLRN-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with a selection of compounds resourced as powders found to be active in secondary assays.  Platelet samples were tested at 10uM, 3uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM concentrations. Following compound addition, platelets were subsequently stimulated with 5 mM SFLLRN.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a gate for the defined probe paths.  A moderate decrease in the amount of P-selectin expressed on the surface of platelets in a dose-dependent manner will identify compounds that inhibit pathways that regulate granule secretion or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) expressed on the surface of platelets.    Lack of substantial inhibition of surface expression of P-selectin is indicative of compounds that might selectively effect dense granule secretion. Additional secondary testing will further delineate the specificity of the probes. 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were tested at different concentrations of compound (100uM, 30uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for cherry-picks and 30uM, 10uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for powders). 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 uM thrombin-receptor-derived hexapeptide SFLLRN from 100 uM stock. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean fluorescence values were collected for each sample.

Description:  The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, core binding factor beta (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in leukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common chromosomal translocation, inv(16). The role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was recently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which abrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well as a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this protein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule inhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia. This dose response assay was developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of compounds inhibiting the binding between the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb-SMMHC via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay" (AID 1434) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Assay materials: 1) His6-tagged Runt domain of Runx (CBFa) and Venus-CBFb-SMMHC were provided by Dr. John Bushweller (University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA). 2) Fluorescent CBFa/b complex working solution: 125 nM Runx-His6 (CBFa), 62.5 nM Venus-CBFb-SMMHC, 1.25 nM Tb-labeled anti-His antibody in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM K2SO4, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, and 0.0125% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1h. 3) Positive control (PC) solution contained untagged CBFb-SMMHC added at 1.25 uM concentration to the CBFa/b working solution Dose-response confirmation protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were 2-fold serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.  2) 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of 10% DMSO. 3) 16 ul of CBFa/b working solution is dispensed into columns 3 through 24 of a black 384-well plate (Greiner #784076) 4) 16 ul of positive control is added to columns 1 and 2. 5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light. 6) The plate is read on a BMG Pherastar using a Lanthascreen filter set: 337ex, 520em and 490em 7) The FRET signal is determined as the ratio of 530/480 signals

Description:  Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359) were nonselective due to agonism of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 9 and active compounds range of activity score is 9 to 100.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is a luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from DiscoveRx. The dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in the uHTS luminescent, beta-arrestin assay for antagonists of the KOR receptor.

Description:  The screen is a reporter-gene assay. GCN4 activity is inversely proportional to eIF2B function in cells. Thus cells with eIF2B mutations exhibit aberrantly high GCN4 expression. The mutant cells contain a chromosomally-integrated gene-fusion to beta-galactosidase. Beta-Galactosidase monitoring thus indirectly measures GCN4 levels and, in turn, eIF2B activity. To perform the assay, we have adapted a coupled beta-galactosidase/ firefly luciferase system (Promega) for use with yeast cells and in HTS format. The growth of mutant and wildtype yeast in the presence of each compound was also monitored and used as a measure of compound toxicity. Mutant yeast cells were grown in 384-well polypropylene plates sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes at 30 C for 16 hrs. After 16 hrs, the cells were mixed using Perkin Elmer Evolution by repeated aspirate-dispense cycles using 30 uL disposable tips. A portion of the cell suspension was lysed with Z-buffer (82 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 9 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1% SDS) in a white 384-well plate. Beta-Glo reagent was added to the lysed cells, and luminescence was measured after 90 min. at room temperature. The remaining cells were transferred to a clear 384-well plate and absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Perkin Elmer Envision spectrophotometer. HTS was performed using 25 uM compound as described below. The screen was repeated using the wild-type yeast cells as a filter to identify compounds having a non-specific effect on the luminescence of both mutant and wild-type yeast.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 of small molecules. This particular assay uses the NIH 3T3 cell line which is derived from mouse fibroblasts. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the NIH 3T3 cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit p97 ATPase activity. This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which contains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed, compounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing the relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well luminescence. Prior to the start of the assay 2.5 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2.5 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with 0.42 uM p97 protein. Next, 40 nL of test compounds (8 uM final nominal concentration) or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by the addition of 2.5 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 10 uM ATP to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 5 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 48 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and luminescence was measured by the ViewLux microplate reader.

Description:  Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay was run to confirm the activity of hits from the primary screen. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine (Eu3+-AB) and the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). FP Assay Reagents: 1. FP reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT. Before use, 0.05% BSA is added. 2. Menin protein, MLL-w.t. labeled with fluorescein, MLL-mutant peptide labeled with texas red. Stored in singe use aliquots at -80C. 3. MLL-w.t. unlabeled peptide as positive control: 10 uM final in FP buffer. FP Assay Procedure: 1. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, and MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM mixture in FP buffer. 2. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM, and 10 uM MLL-w.t. unlabeled mixture in FP buffer. 3. Prepare MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM and MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM mixture in FP buffer. 3. Dispense 4 ul per well of reagent in step 1 in columns 2, 4 - 48 in a black 1536 well plate, dispense 4 ul per well of reagents from steps 2 and 3 in columns 1 and 3 respectively. Incubate plate at ambient for 15 minutes. 4. Transfer 23 nl per well of compound to plate and incubate at ambient for 1 hr. 5. Read fluorescence polarization for each label using the PerkinElmer Envision. Envision protocol for fluorescein: FITC FP Dual Enh Mirror, Excitation filter 480, Emission filter (1) P-pol 535, Emission filter (2) S-pol 535 Envision protocol for texas red: FP Dual Enh Mirror, Excitation filter 555, Emission filter (1) P-pol 632, Emission filter (2) S-pol 632

Description:  The activity of PMK was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of absorbance (OD340) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for PMK inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited PMK and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of PMK. Phosphomevalonate Kinase Protocol for 384-well HTS 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 3 mM MgCl2 2 mM ATP 0.04 mM Phosphomevalonate 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.4 mM NADH 3 units/ml rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 3 units/ml rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase 30 nM Phosphomevalonate Kinase (PMK) 4% DMSO The assay was run in 384-well clear non-binding plates.  Fifteen uL substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 uL volumes using the FX.  The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL of PMK using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the PMK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing PMK with hexokinase. Data were analyzed using IDBS ActivityBase software.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases. Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that were purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single particular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated against different GTPase targets. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock concentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine CRC serial dilutions were prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates. Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine. Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a one of eight concentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for the Acetylcholine CRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence of a fixed high concentration (30 uM final concentration) of each test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope).  The degree of potentiation or foldshift of the ACh CRC induced by the test compound was calculated by dividing the EC50 for ACh plus vehicle by the EC50 for ACh in the presence of test compound. Foldshift values less than 3 were considered 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'. Foldshift values of greater than 3 were assigned as 'Active.' For values of 3-30, a 'Score' of '50' was assigned and for values greater than 30 a 'Score' of '100' was assigned.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)," (PubChem AID 793) were nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of the Y1 receptor. A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units. As designed, test compounds that increase probe fluorescence in Y1 cells are considered non-selective antagonists. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3,600 Y1 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above but without Geneticin and Puromycin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (25 nM final nominal concentration; NPY's EC95) in PBS. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; isoproterenol's EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724 (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((RatioTest_Compound - Median Ratio High_Control)/ (Median Ratio Low_Control - Median Ratio High_Control))]*100 Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. LowControl is defined as wells with DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. HighControl is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Species of Leishmania are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases throughout the tropics and subtropics, ranging from self-healing ulcers to highly disfiguring lesions and serious, often lethal visceral diseases, such as kala-azar. In Leishmania spp. it has been shown that both sugar uptake and gluconeogenesis are necessary to synthesize sufficient hexose-phosphate required for the production of glycoconjugates and the intracellular polysaccharide mannan which are essential for both replication and virulence of the parasites. Therefore, most of the enzymes participating in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are expected to be essential. The assay described here targets pyruvate kinase from Leishmania mexicania (LmPYK) that was obtained as a highly purified preparation from the University of Edinburgh (E451W mutant was provided).  A 1536 well assay protocol was set up and validated by screening the LOPAC library in triplicate as an eight point concentration-titration series using the qHTS platform developed at the NCGC. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentrations, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid medium binding Greiner 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration, 0.2 nM LmPYK, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. Plates were covered with stainless steel gasket-lined lids and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Lonza) was added, and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 2 second exposure/plate using 2x binning. Controls on each plate were as follows: column 1, sixteen-point titration (1:2 dilutions) in duplicate the LmPK activator LOPAC-C8145 beginning at 57 uM final concentration; column 2, sixteen-point titration (1:2 dilutions) in duplicate activator LOPAC-S4063 beginning at 57 uM final concentration; column 3, column 4 DMSO only. Data were normalized to the neutral control (column 3).

Description:  The high-throughput screen for complement factor C1s inhibitors reported here consisted of an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled tripeptide. The MLSCN compound library was screened as mixtures of 10 compounds per well and active compounds were confirmed by single compound IC50 determination. One of our goals at the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery (PCMD) is to develop capabilities for screening multiple members of target classes, for example serine and cysteine proteases. Many HTS labs focus effort on one target of interest within a class due to resource and time constraints. A few compounds are then tested for selectivity against additional target class members during the hit-to-lead process. Our goal is to test the entire MLSCN compound library against multiple serine and cysteine proteases to obtain a profile of activity against these enzymes classes. This profile may then be used to immediately identify selective compounds during subsequent screening of novel enzyme targets. It may also be possible to identify a subset of the library with an enhanced hit rate towards these enzyme families that might provide the basis for gene family screening. One strategy that enables the rapid screening of multiple targets is to screen compound mixtures. We chose to evaluate an orthogonal pooling strategy that gives 10 compounds per well, as described in detail below. An advantage of this method is that each compound is in two plates, mixed with a different set of 9 other compounds at each location. This duplication improves the HTS statistics and greatly simplifies deconvolution of the results as activity in both wells containing a given compound immediately identifies that compound as a hit. This method has been used with some success in several pharmaceutical companies. Complement factor C1s (0.02 mg/mL) was incubated with Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 2.5 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 50 uM compound mixture (5 uM each of 10 compounds). Hits were confirmed on single compounds by IC50 determination as described below. HTS protocol 1.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 2.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 3.Add 200 nL of compound mixture (2.5 mM in DMSO) using Evolution pintool 4.Add 1 uL of Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 5.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.04 mg/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 6.Incubate for 2.5 hr at room temperature 7.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader

Description:  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fulfills multiple cellular functions (reviewed in [1-4]).  The lumen of the ER contains high concentration of Ca2+ due to the transport of calcium ions into the ER by Ca2+-ATPases.  The lumen possesses an oxidative environment, critical for formation of disulfide-bonds and proper folding of proteins destined for secretion or display on the cell surface.  Because of its role in protein folding and transport, the ER is also rich in Ca2+-dependent molecular chaperones, such as Grp78, Grp94, and calreticulin, which help stabilize protein folding intermediates. This work's aim is to identify chemical compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER stress using a cell-based survival assay. Using secondary assays, selectivity of these compounds for the ER stress pathway was defined, and the principal signaling events that are inhibited were dissected.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. IC50 protocol 1. Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2. Fill Corning low-volume 384-well black plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4. Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205. (Four parameter logistic fit; maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively; Hill slope limited to > -0.1.)

Description:  Counterscreen assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R; HCRTR2), run by assay provider. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492964) are non-selective due to activation of OX2R. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX2R/Hcrtr2 (CHO-OX2R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX2R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX2R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX2R/Hcrtr2 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX2R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, , 10 ug/mL Blasticidin. The day of the assay, 15000 cells in 7 uL of 1X Stimulation Buffer were seeded into each well of 384-well low volume plates, spun down at 300 rpm for 1 minute. Plates were then incubated for a couple of hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 until time of Assay. Then, 3.5 uL of test compound (4X concentration) in 1X Stimulation buffer 2%DMSO and antagonist controls were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 3.5 uL of Orexin-A agonist (4X concentration) in 1X Stimulation Buffer and 0.5% DMSO (EC90 average response were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 3 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Next, 3 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Plates were read in Perkin Elmer Envision instrument with 665/620 filter set recommended by Cisbio Protocol. The IP-One ratio was calculated by: ( 665_nm / 620_nm * 10,000 ) In this assay, test compounds are wells containing test compound, low controls are wells containing 1X Stimulation buffer and 0.5% DMSO, and high controls are wells containing Agonist Orexin A 5 uM. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration using GraphPad Prism. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 100 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 100 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-68 and for inactive compounds 63-0.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 10uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO (Sigma D8418) 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Dynorphin final concentration was 1uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml.

Description:  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small (~20-25 nucleotides), nonprotein-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional repression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Estimated to be involved in the regulation of 30% of all protein-coding mRNAs, miRNAs play a significant role in many biological processes including cellular differentiation and tissue development. Not surprisingly, miRNAs have been found to be oncogenic or tumor suppressive, with altered miRNA expression levels associated with human cancers. The miRNA miR-21 has been found to be expressed in most human tissues, and its overexpression has been associated with a variety of human tumors. miR-21 has been shown to be anti-apoptotic: knock-down of miR-21 in a glioblastoma cell line was found to activate caspases and lead to apoptosis. Identification of small molecules that modulate miR-21 specifically, or miRNAs generally, would prove useful as tools to better understand miRNA biogenesis and mRNA regulation by miRNAs. Of special interest are compounds that specifically inhibit miR-21, and a cell-based firefly luciferase reporter gene assay optimized for 1536-well format quantitative HTS (qHTS) was developed and performed in an effort to identify such compounds. Compounds active in the miR-21 FLuc assay were clustered using Leadscope and active chemical series were prioritized based on chemical properties, potential for medicinal chemistry optimization, and SAR. Within each chemical series, representative compounds were re-acquired to test for activity in a secondary assay based on the quality of their CRC, efficacy, and potency. The secondary assay to determine if compounds active in the miR-21 FLuc assay were potentially specific for miR-21 and were not general modulators of the miRNA pathway was another cell-based FLuc reporter gene assay, this time targeting miR-30. Compounds found active in both the miR-21 FLuc and miR-30 FLuc assays are not considered miR-21 specific compounds, and may be general miRNA modulators.   HeLa cells stably expressing firefly luciferase (FLuc) under the control of a CMV promoter (upstream) and a miR-30 binding sequence directly downstream of the gene. These cells also stably express miR-30. Control compounds used were compound C3 (provided by collaborator), N6-phenyladenosine (MP Biomedicals, 0215379625), and DMSO. Assay Summary: 6uL of HeLa miR-30-FLuc cells in assay buffer (DMEM, Invitrogen #21063-029; 10% FBS, HyClone #SH30071.03) were dispensed at 1000cells/well (1.7 x 105 cells/mL) into Greiner solid-white TC-treated 1536-well plates using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated for one hour at 37 degree Celsius, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. These assay plates were then treated with 23nL of compound or DMSO using a Kalypsys pin tool, which allows for delivery of a 24-point titration of each compound to the assay plate, with a final compound concentration ranging from approximately 40uM to 5pM. Assay plates were then incubated for 48 hours. After incubation, plates were allowed to come to RT for one hour prior to delivery of 3uL of 3X luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minute incubation to allow for cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using a ViewLux CCD imager (PerkinElmer), with an average exposure time of 2-12 seconds.

Description:  Species of Leishmania are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases throughout the tropics and subtropics, ranging from self-healing ulcers to highly disfiguring lesions and serious, often lethal visceral diseases, such as kala-azar. In Leishmania spp. it has been shown that both sugar uptake and gluconeogenesis are necessary to synthesize sufficient hexose-phosphate required for the production of glycoconjugates and the intracellular polysaccharide mannan which are essential for both replication and virulence of the parasites. Therefore, most of the enzymes participating in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are expected to be essential. The assay described here targets pyruvate kinase from Leishmania mexicania (LmPYK) that was obtained as a highly purified preparation from the University of Edinburgh (E451W mutant was provided).  A 1536 well assay protocol was set up and validated by screening the LOPAC library in triplicate as an eight point concentration-titration series using the qHTS platform developed at the NCGC. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentrations, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid medium binding Greiner 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration, 0.2 nM LmPYK, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. Plates were covered with stainless steel gasket-lined lids and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Lonza) was added, and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 2 second exposure/plate using 2x binning. Controls on each plate were as follows: column 1, sixteen-point titration (1:2 dilutions) in duplicate the LmPK activator LOPAC-C8145 beginning at 57 uM final concentration; column 2, sixteen-point titration (1:2 dilutions) in duplicate activator LOPAC-S4063 beginning at 57 uM final concentration; column 3, column 4 DMSO only. Data were normalized to the neutral control (column 3).

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by project collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30 nanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. This design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is associated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead sets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635 nm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7 might be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead control (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a fluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the test compounds. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of 218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds. RGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of the measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative control bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that particular protein is "inconclusive", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS Protein is "inconclusive", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant amounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the measured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control bead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702 compounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. Sample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background fluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound. The background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value of the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay, instead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the controls are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized response value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation: RV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value based on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound (|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. RV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and RGS7, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8, compounds were considered "Active" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library dependent "edge effect" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the data set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered "Active". Data from compounds located in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than 0 or greater than 135 were considered "Active". Active compounds include both activators - where %Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the 218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as potential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per protein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are RGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific. RGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel, which can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has the lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest bead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead set, the compound is flagged as "Potential Red Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as potential red fluorescent compounds. The Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library, average Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when excluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard deviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for target RGS16, due to the library dependent "edge effect", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68 standard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity of the protein. For easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the same compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an activator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column Ri_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where "i" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.

Description:  HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases. Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral phenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the piperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring other heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with piperidine. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  Schistosoma mansoni, a causative agent of schistosomiasis, resides in the bloodstream of their host up to 30 years without being eliminated by the host immune attack. One proposed survival mechanism is the production of an antioxidant "firewall" that neutralizes the oxidative assault of the host's immune attack. Schistosoma mansoni peroxiredoxins (Prx) are important parasite antioxidant proteins that play a crucial role in redox balance mechanisms. Data strongly suggest the possible use of Prx as novel drug targets. Buffer: 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20. Reagents / Controls: 100 uM NADPH in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (fully inhibited, zero % activity). 100 uM NADPH/25 nM TGR/700 uM GSH/50 nM Prx2 mixture in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Titration of control potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT, from 1 mM, then 1:5) pin-transferred to lower half of column 2. Column 1 and upper half of column 2 are neutral (100% activity). Three uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black plates. Compounds and controls (20 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then a 1 uL aliquot of 400 uM NADPH/700 uM GSH was added, immediately followed by a 1uL aliquot of 2.5 mM H2O2 (to start the reaction). The plate was transferred to ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager where kinetic measurements (every 30 sec, for a total of 8 min) of NADPH fluorescence were taken using 365 nm excitation/450 nm emission filter set. During dispense, enzyme-containing reagent bottles were kept submerged into 4 deg C water bath to minimize degradation.

Description:  The existence of several receptors mediating estrogen response via multiple pathways complicates the investigation of the independent effects of each receptor. In addition to estrogen, a variety of steroidal and non-steroidal compounds bind and modulate estrogen receptor activity, often with varying results depending on the receptor in question. For example, antagonists of the classical estrogen receptors, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, are commonly used in the clinic to treat cancer and osteoperosis; however, these compounds act as agonists of GPR30, complicating treatment as well as basic research on the various receptors. To this end, it would be beneficial to identify small molecules with distinct binding activities for each receptor as well as differential functional characteristics. These small molecule probes will be potentially useful not only in the study and characterization of ERalpha, ERbeta and GPR30 but will also have possible therapeutic value as specific agonists and antagonists of a single receptor in cancer therapy as well as treatment of other estrogen-mediated pathologies. To identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERalpha, a competitive binding approach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This assay measures the ability of small molecules with unknown ERalpha binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERalpha in permeabilized whole cells expressing ERalpha-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind ERalpha will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with ERalpha-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer#s instructrions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Columns 3-22 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Primary screening was completed at 10 microM as well as 100 nanoM to identify a select number of relatively potent primary hits. Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen) wells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells. Compounds were considered "Active" if they inhibited more than 65% of binding at either 10 microM or 100 nanoM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives." The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding compared with activity cutoff (i.e., 65%). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff (i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity cutoff: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff) where Cutoff was 65% and %Inhibition was the maximum %inhibition above the Cutoff between 10 microM and 100 nanoM experiments. The %Inhibition was calculated by: %Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF) where Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was the average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells (i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).

Description:  This project aims to identify small drug-like molecules that activate (agonists) the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) or enhance its TRH-stimulated activity (allosteric enhancers). TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders. Upon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. A cytosolic calcium indicator exhibits increased fluorescence in the presence of calcium release. This primary screen measures compound-induced enhancement of an EC20 stimulation of the receptor by its native ligand. For the HTS assay freshly prepared cells are plated at a density of 2000/well in 3 ul of complete DMEM medium containing 10% serum in 1536-well plates and cultured over night at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The next day, 2 ul of a no wash calcium dye (ABD Bioquest) was added to the cells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For the assay, assay plates were loaded into the FDSS kinetic plate reader.  A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as TRH controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  A cell line containing the S1P3 receptor, the promiscuous G-alpha-15 protein (Ga15) as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure nonspecific compound effects. When the cells are stimulated transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity is proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment 51 compounds were tested to determine individual EC50 values. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations. The highest test concentration was nominally 43 micromolar. The assay was conducted in 384-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of S1P at a concentration equal to its EC100. A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-16 promiscuous coupling protein was used.  Compounds specific for the 5HT1E receptor should not activate beta-lactamase expression in this cell-line. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, part 26400-044), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 600 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 200ug/ml Hygromycin(Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate and the plate is incubated overnight at 37 C, 5% C02 in a humidified incubator.  43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative control wells) was added to the appropriate wells. S1P, the agonist for the S1P3 receptor was added to positive control wells to a final concentration of 1.0 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm.  The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation= ((test_compound - median_negative_control)/(median_positive_control - median_negative_control))*100 The negative control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the positive controls wells were treated with the EC100 of S1P. For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This result in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.

Description:  The cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of drug dependence and addiction disorders.  GPR55, an orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, has been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor, but its status as such remains unresolved due to conflicting results from pharmacological studies.  The goal of the project is to identify small molecule agonists of GPR55, which may aid in the deorphanization efforts of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR55 in drug addiction. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPR55 activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits and further into endosomal vesicles.  This arrestin-GFP redistribution is measured as increased local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins.  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in " Image-based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55" (AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR55 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 100ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Lysophosphatidylinositol (Sigma L7635, 5mM stock in Methanol water) diluted in water to 250uM. Additional DMSO is added to achieve a DMSO concentration of 5%. 5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO. 6) Test Compounds Working Solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1 and 24. LPI (positive control) final concentration was 10uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2 and 23. DMSO final concentration was 0.3%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 75 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings:  20x 0.45 NA air objective  Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels  2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters   4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the HUV-EC-C cell line which is derived from normal human vascular endothelial cells. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the HUV-EC-C cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Cos7 cells (ATCC # CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. 200,000 cells were seeded into 6- well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with ERalpha-GFP and PH-RFP at a ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, per manufacturers instructions). Six hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto 12 milliM glass coverslips (7500 cells / coverslip) and allowed to adhere for 18 hours, at which point media was changed and cells were grown in phenol-red free, serum-free DMEM F-12 containing Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine for 24 hours prior to assay. Transfected cells were stimulated with compound, vehicle or estrogen to assess PI3K translocation in response to estrogen-mediated signaling. To screen for agonist activity, compound was applied to cells and incubated at 37 degreesC for 15 minutes. For assessment of antagonist activity, cells were firs incubated with potential antagonist for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, then sitmulated with low-dose estrogen (10 nanoM) for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, washed 3x with PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were stored at -20 degreesC prior to visualization. Assessment of translocation of the PI3P reporter, PH-RFP, was visually scored. Compounds which fully translocated PH-RFP to the nucleus (equal to estrogen-mediated translocation) were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds with a moderate level of PH-RFP translocation were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 50 and compounds which induced no translocation of PH-RFP were assigned a value of 0. Scoring of antagonists was as completed in a similar manner, with compunds that completely blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, compounds which partially blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a score of 50, and all inactive compounds assigned a score of 0. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME was based on the activity scores, with "Active" compunds being those with PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCOREs of 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "In-active" compounds having a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0-50 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.

Description:  The aim of this assay is to characterize selectivity of compounds originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Antagonists of GPR35" (AID 2058) against the unrelated vasopressin receptor. Compounds were either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized by the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics. This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and human vasopressin receptor type IIa.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits. This arrestin-GFP redistribution is measured as increased local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins.

Description:  Formyl peptide receptors.  The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the originating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1.  The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform  was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. Test compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as %Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)] in which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells containing test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of cells in negative control wells, respectively. Test compounds were hit-picked at a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations.  Final concentrations in the assay ranged from 10.2 nanoM to 66.7 microM. In an individual dose response experiment, each compound was tested in duplicate to result in 18 data points. Some compounds were tested in more than one dose-response experiment. The number of data points for dose response curves ranged from 18 (a single experiment) to 90 (5 experiments). In some cases individual data points were determined to be statistical outliers and were eliminated from the analysis. FPRL1 expression ranged from 100,000 to 200,000 receptors per cell in different assays as determined by comparison to standard curves generated with Fluorescein Reference Standard Microbeads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN).  This corresponded to total FPRL1 concentrations of 0.6 to 1.2 nanoM.  To account for effects of possible ligand depletion at the higher receptor concentrations, inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from IC50 estimates Ki determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in the dose response assay. Test compounds with Ki less than 10 microM were scored as active and all others as inactive. The activity scores of active compounds were calculated as: Activity Score = 100 x ( 1 - (Ki / Ki_Max) ) In which Ki_Max was 10 microM, the upper Ki threshold for an active test compound. Full sets of curve-fit statistics were reported only for test compounds in which the estimated IC50 was less than 66.7 microM, the highest test compound concentration evaluated. This corresponded to an upper reported Ki limit of 40.3 microM. All other test compounds were reported to have IC50 values greater than 66.7 microM and Ki values greater than 40.3 microM.

Description:  Thyroid receptor (TR) regulates many homeostatic processes including basal metabolism, cardiovascular function, body weight, and lipid trafficking. TR modulators are potential therapeutics for obesity and hyperlipidemias but current thyroid analogs have undesirable side effects, particularly cardiac stimulation. To identify inhibitors that specifically prevent the interaction of TR with the steroid receptor coregulator 2 (SRC2), a fluorescence polarization assay was screened. This assay detects interaction of the ligand-binding domain of human TRb with a Texas Red labeled SRC2 peptide, corresponding to a 20 amino acid region of the nuclear receptor interaction domain. Small molecule inhibitors that block the interaction of TR and SRC2 are detected by a decrease in fluorescence polarization. For screening, 5 uL/well 0.6 uM TRb and 20 nM SRC2 Texas Red in protein buffer (20mM Tris hydrochloride, 100mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40, 1mM DTT, 1uM T3 and 5% DMSO) was dispensed into black solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 5 hr at ambient temperature. The plates were read by an Envision (Perkin Elmer) to detect fluorescence polarization of SRC2 Texas Red (555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission). Data were normalized to unbound (all components except TRb) and bound SRC2 Texas Red controls. In this assay, we provide % activity data for each concentration as well as potencies for the active compounds.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to act as potentiators or agonists of the NPY-Y1 receptor (Y1). A cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the EC10 NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and therefore reduced probe fluorescence. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC10 (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before a fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = (Median_Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  Counter screen for luciferase inhibitors of Dense Granule Secretion. 20ul of 1.5uM ATP (Sigma, #A1852)  in PBS is plated in 384-well white assay plates (Aurora, 00030721) and was exposed to the 1584 cherry-picked compounds chosen based on activity of the platelet dense granule release primary screen (AID1663) and structure to compounds with the highest activity, to provide some SAR data.  A dose-response plate with the positive control Resveratrol (Sigma #5010, Lot#038K5202, BRD-K80738081, CID445154) was included in the run  After compound addition, the detection reagent CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G755) was resuspend and diluted in PBS by the same protocol as for the primary screen.  Luminescence measurements are taken immediately after reagent addition. Expected Outcome: Compounds that inhibit luciferase from acting on the luciferin substrate contained within the CellTiter-Glo reagent will exhibit a decrease in luminescent signal. Normalization and dose-response curves will be fit using the Genedata Screener applications.  The activity determination from this assay (IC50) will be compared to the activity determined from retest of the primary screen by calculation of the ratio of the two.  The compounds showing a greater than 10-fold difference in activity will be further analyzed for the specific mechanism in which platelet activation is inhibited. Taken from 2016-02-W01-01 1.  Reagents are prepared for the assay:      a. Frozen aliquots of 10mM ATP in PBS is thawed and diluted to 1.5uM in PBS.  Enough reagent is prepared for the run (8ml/plate + extra dead volume for liquid handling).      b.  Frozen aliquots of CellTiter-Glo (Promega) (CTG) in PBS is thawed and diluted in PBS 1:4. Enough reagent is prepared for the run (4ml/plate + extra dead volume for liquid handling). 2.  A MultiDrop Combi (Thermo) is prepared with a standard cassette that is washed and primed with the reagent.  Plates are filled with 20&#956;l of 1.5uM ATP in PBS. 3. Compounds are added using the CyBi-Well (CyBio Inc.).  50nl are pinned using the 25nl pin array, which is programed for 2 seperate dips into the compound plate, seperated by a pin wash cycle. 4. During compound addition, a MultiDrop Combi is prepared for second reagent addition by washing cassette and priming with new reagent. 5.  Upon completion of compound addition, 10&#956;l of CTG (1:4) in PBS is added to every well. 6.  Plates are transferend to an Envison Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) to measure luminesence.  The ultra sensitive detection is used, with the 1536 aperture in place, to decrease bleed-through from adjacent wells.  Read time is 0.1s/well.

Description:  This TNAP dose response assay is developed and performed for the purpose of SAR study on analogs of hits originally identified in the TNAP luminescent HTS assay.             Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters, releasing phosphate and alcohol. APs are dimeric enzymes found in the most organism. In human, four isozymes of APs have been identified. Three isozymes are tissue-specific and the fourth one is tissue-nonsepecifc, named TNAP. TNAP deficiency is associated with defective bone mineralization in the form of rickets and osteomalacia. Therefore, there are therapeutic potentials of inhibiting TNAP activity. The goal of this HTS is to identify novel and specific inhibitors of TNAP. TNAP assay materials: 1) TNAP protein was provided by Dr. Jose Luis Millan (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). The CDP-star was obtained from Applied Biosystems. 2) Assay Buffer: 250 mM DEA, pH 9.8, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.05 mM ZnCl. 3) TNAP working solution contained a 1/800 dilution in assay buffer. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 4) CDP-star working solution contained 125 uM CDP-star in MQ water. 5) Levamisole working solution - 5 mM in 10% DMSO.             TNAP dose-response protocol: 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22 of Greiner 384-well white small-volume plates (784075). Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of levamisole working solution and 10% DMSO, respectively. 2) 8 uL of TNAP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 3) 8 uL of CDP-star working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 4) Plates were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. 5) Luminescence was measured on the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). 6) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc) using sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression

Description:  The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. A set of 9,993 compounds, designated the 10K Set Type 1 (10KST1), and a separate set of 16,322 compounds, designated the 17K Set Type 1 (17KST1), was obtained from the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) maintained by Discovery Partners International in conjunction with the NIH Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network. There was an overlap of 2,595 compounds common to the two sets so that the total number of unique compounds evaluated in these two sets was 23,720. An additional 586 compounds were cherry picked from the remainder of the MLSMR compound collection on the basis of a previously described virtual screening approach for predicting FPR activity The primary high throughput screening (HTS) assay was performed in 384 well format. Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPR. The FPRL1 primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately (AID 441) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPR binding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and specificity of compounds identified to have FPRL1 binding activity in the FPRL1 primary HTS assay report (AID 441) For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until recently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1 selective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which prohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1 PAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all allosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse chemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS. Assay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. Acetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca. EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compound dose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for compounds with EC50 < 1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50 > 1uM.

Description:  Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay was to determine antagonist activity of powder compounds against S1P1 receptor. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well in 384-well plates, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected using a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). This particular assay uses a high density of sampling across concentration-response space to establish more confidence estimates of potency. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in 1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's software data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol: (1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The calcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. (3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 to 120 min. (4) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000. (5) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. (6) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. Record agonist response for 210 s. (7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM NPS). Record antagonist response for 140 s.

Description:  Dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 631).  Additionally, compounds selected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation value (compared to AID 631) in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by PPARgamma" (PubChem AID 1032) and "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by PPARgamma" (PubChem AID 731). This assay tests the ability of compounds to increase interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-1, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-1 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that promote the association of SRC-1 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies.  As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 601-762].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (10 micromolar final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.

A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 49 and active compounds range of activity score is 49 to 100.

Description:  HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions . Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has become an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently labeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with labeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design where an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are immobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently assessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based assays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using differentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the RGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and RGS19. Protocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the exception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay concentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial dilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature. Specificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of blank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking peptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single tube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex for 30-90 min. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file that is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible_Fluorescent_Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound, percent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%. Percent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following equation: %Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl) where all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is from the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of %Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100. The %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to determine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with significant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd where [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.

Description:  The apparent binding of compounds to Human RGS18 has been measured using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) technique. In this approach, the unfolding of the protein is monitored via a fluorescent hydrophobicity-sensing dye: SYPRO orange (Invitrogen). The hyperbolic curve of increase in fluorescence intensity versus temperature shows the unfolding process. The point of inflexion of this trace provides the measured parameter known as Tm. A difference in Tm between a control without the compound and an experiment with the compound present is called a TmShift. Positive shifts indicate that the protein is more stable in the presence of the compound, indicating that the compound is bound. Since it is not possible to quantitatively compare TmShift values from different experiments containing different components, we mark positive shifts of more than 3 degrees celcius as having a PubChem assay score of 100, and all other shifts with a score of 0. Regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins contain domains that terminate the signal emanating from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). When a GPCR binds a specific ligand, a signal is generated that is transmitted to the G-proteins that consist of Galpha and Gbeta-gamma subunits. In the inactive state, Galpha and Gbeta-gamma exist as a complex with the Galpha GTPase in the inactive GDP bound form. Upon activation, GDP is replaced with GTP which induces Galpha; and Gbeta-gamma complex disassociation. At this stage both Galpha and Gbeta-gamma proteins are active. Galpha does have an intrinsic GTPase activity but this is greatly enhanced by the association with an RGS domain. Hence RGS proteins act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Once GTP hydrolysis has taken place the GDP-Galpha protein can recombine with Gbeta-gamma thus terminating the signal. RGS18 is a member of the B/R4 subfamily of RGS proteins. All of these subfamily members have an N-terminal amphipathic helix which enhances the localisation of the protein to the membrane surface where it is ideally placed to interact with the G-proteins. Its expression is most abundant in platelets and megakaryocytes and it binds to Galpha-i1, Galpha-i2, Galpha-i3, and Galpha-q but not Galpha-z, Galpha-s or Galpha-12. Although no direct link to any specific disease is yet proven, RGS18 is believed to play roles in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis, in platelet activation, and as an inhibitor for chemokine-induced dendritic cell migration, acting primarily via modulation of Gq signaling.

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 7 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 50 units/well catalase (from bovine liver, Sigma cat#100), 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 7 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  Late stage results for the probe development effort to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization: TR-FRET-based biochemical dose response assay for HCV core inhibitors. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for powder samples of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 1899), "TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 2152), and "TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 2159). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies and energy transfer from Europium to XL-665, leading to inhibition of well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 uM unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of 10-points serial dilutions of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 uM and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000 Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 uM of unlabelled Core106 protein. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactives 60-0.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control. Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly testing the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected to identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well as in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function. The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and activated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under conditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule inhibitors of each of these GTPases Compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.  The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity relationships for the different GTPases. Based on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral phenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the piperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring other heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with piperidine. Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4 degrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. Test compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the data via GraphPad Prism. Calculations: In dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the following equation: %Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl) where SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl is the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO. The %Response was 100% for compounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound increased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP. The % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. Assessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following criteria: - -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations) - STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the absolute value of LOGEC50) - 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2) For compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the following equation: Ki = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd where [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd is the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as follows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt 18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following equations: SCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 ) And compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of the %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the tested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response values at lowest to highest concentration. An active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of 3.75 mM compound was added to the cell solutions (7.5 uM final [compound]). The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in dose (12-point, 2-fold dilution, from 20 uM final [compound]) and was incorporated at the beginning and end of each days run. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured. Taken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07 1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media pre-warmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. Replicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final concentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 8) Plates with compound were then re-lidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.

Description:  The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma is a transcription factor that has a central role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been implicated in graft versus host disease, autoimmune disease and asthma. ROR gamma is induced in naive T helper cells in the presence of TGF-beta combined with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23, and thereafter directs the expression of the Th17 lineage cytokines. To identify nonspecific inhibitors, a Drosophila Schneider cell line was stably transfected with two vectors: a gene expressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and VP16 transactivation domain under the control of the metallothionine promoter and a Photinus luciferase reporter regulated by the Gal4 binding site enhancer, UAS. The addition of copper to the medium induced expression of the Gal4-VP16 gamma fusion that subsequently induced the UAS-luciferase reporter. Small molecule inhibitors that inhibit components common to the RORgt and VP16 assays, such as the Gal4 DNA binding domain or the UAS luciferase reporter, will be active in both assays and thus scored as nonspecific. For screening, 600 cells in 4 uL/well were dispensed into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature, and 1 uL/well copper sulfate (700 uM final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 20 hr at ambient temperature. After addition of 1.5 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.

Description:  Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2) A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to measure S1P2 antagonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. In this assay, cells have been stimulated with the S1P agonist, which stimulates the S1P2 receptor, hence increasing BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by exogenously added S1P. Therefore, in the presence of a potential S1P2 antagonist, transcription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. In this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 microliter of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 750 nanomolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 microliter of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from both the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control)/(Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Low Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P and 3.1 micromolar JTE-013, corresponding to 100% antagonism High Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P, corresponding to its EC80 A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared as an inhibitor. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-010) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Cell-based dose response high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1510) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (AID 1524). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether these compounds are nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit S1P1 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 45 and active compounds range of activity score is 45 to 100.

Description:  The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]. The purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M4 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M4-expressing CHO cells as described. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 ul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less. Shirey JK, Xiang Z, Orton D, Brady AE, Johnson KA, Williams R, Ayala JE,Rodriguez AL, Wess J, Weaver D, Niswender CM, Conn PJ., "An allosteric potentiator of M4 mAChR modulates hippocampal synaptic transmission." Nat Chem Biol. 2008 Jan;4(1):42-50. PMID: 18059262 Data Fitting: Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'

Description:  Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput dose response assay for inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide. Cancer initialization and survival depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although an effective mechanism for anti-cancer chemotherapeutics is apoptosis induction, cancer cells develop resistance to the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) are two well-characterized lymphoid cancers (3). Bcl-2 is an oncoprotein activated in these lymphomas, and serves to inhibit apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic compounds. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are regulated by protein-protein interactions, forming homo- and heterodimers (4, 5). One of these proteins, MCL1, is essential for survival of human MM cells (6). MCL1 and other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xl share Bcl-2's ability to oppose apoptosis, as well as sequence homology in 4 a-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1-BH4 (3). As a result, these proteins are promising targets for studies on tumor initiation, progression and apoptosis resistance. Research showing that MCL1 opposes cell death (7), is highly expressed in hematopoetic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors (8), and that inhibiting Bcl-2 protein-protein interactions via the crucial BH3 domain is a valid approach to cancer drug development (2, 9, 10), suggest that targeted therapies for MCL1 are needed. The identification of selective inhibitors of MCL1 will provide useful tools for the study of lymphoid tumorigenesis, and elucidate mechanisms for apoptosis induction in resistant cancers. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide" (AID 2057), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide (AID 2168). This biochemical assay monitors binding of the BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 family member, Bim, to the binding pocket of human MCL1. In this fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay, GST-MCL1 fusion protein is incubated with FITC-BH3-Bim peptides, in the presence of test compounds. Binding of peptide to MCL1 target protein increases the effective molecular mass of the peptide, slowing its rotation and increasing millipolarization (mP) units in the well. As designed, compounds that inhibit MCL1 will prevent binding of Bim peptide to MCL1, and increase the proportion of free to bound peptides, thereby reducing mP in the well. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) containing 9.2 nM GST-MCL1 were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, unlabeled Bim-BH3 control peptide (0.770 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 8.0 nanomolar FITC-BH3-Bim peptide in assay buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) into all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 595nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_ Positive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing unlabeled Bim-BH3 peptide. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 109 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive compounds 87-0.

Description:       BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes(DUB). These proteases reverse the conjugation of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions. In order to identify molecular probes for studying DUB function and for targeting DUB for potential therapeutic applications, an enzyme-based kinetic high throughput assay has been developed. The assay monitors the hydrolysis of simple ubiquitin conjugates such as Ub-AMC by cysteine protease activity of BAP1 and the release of free AMC. The amount of the fluorescence intensity of released free AMC is proportional to the BAP1 activity. This BAP1 assay has been optimized for HTS. 1. Dilute BAP1 and Ub-AMC (provided by investigator) using Tris-HCl Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 10 mM DTT). 2. Add 25 ul of BAP1 (5 nM) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls. 3. Transfer 0.5 ul of compounds (2 mM in DMSO) to 384-well plate and the final compound concentration is 20uM. 4. Add 25 ul of 800 nM Ub-AMC. 5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using the kinetic settings. An excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 425 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 400 nm. The plate was read every 1'45" for 15 readings. Controls include:  DMSO only (negative control), Ub-vinyl sulfone (known inhibitor = positive control), and substrate alone (blank)

Description:  This HePTP dose response assay is developed and performed for the purpose of SAR study on analogs of hits originally identified in the HePTPcolorimetric HTS assay (AID 521). Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), working with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), control the phosphorylation state of many proteins in the signal transduction pathways. HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. HePTP assay materials: 1) HePTP protein was provided by Dr. Mustelin (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA). The pNPP pellets were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (S0942). Biomol Green reagent was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc (AK-111) 2) Assay Buffer: 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.0125% Tween 20. 3) HePTP working solution contained 6.875 nM HePTP in assay buffer. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 4) pNPP working solution contained 1 mM pNPP in MQ water. Solution was prepared fresh prior to use. 5) Vanadate working solution - 45 mM Na3VO4 in 10% DMSO HePTP dose-response protocol: 1)Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22 of Greiner 384-well white small-volume plates (784075). Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of vanadate working solution and 10% DMSO, respectively. 2)8 uL of HePTP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 3)8 uL of pNPP working solution was added to the whole plate using WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix). 4)Plates were incubated for 1h at room temperature. 5)Absorbance at 620 nM was measured on the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). 6)Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc) using sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression

Description:  The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. Caspase 1 was prepared in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Cys (Aldrich cat# 861677), 0.1% CHAPS) at a concentration of 66.6 nM and 3 uL was dispensed to all wells using black solid Kalypsys 1536-well plates. 20 nL of DMSO containing compounds was added using a pin-tool (Kalypsys Inc.) to columns 5-48. Then 20 nL of DMSO solution from a control plate was added to columns 1-4. Controls were: Column 1, 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate (1:1 dilutions in DMSO; final starting concentration was 57 uM) of the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-CHO (Alexis Biochemicals); Column 2, a 16 point titration with each concentration in duplicate of the free AFC fluorophore prepared in DMSO (Alexis Biochemicals), final starting was 40 uM; Column 3 neutral (DMSO only) control; Column 4:  DMSO alone, to serve as a negative control (no substrate was added). Then 1 uL of 20 uM the substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC (Alexis Biochemicals) prepared in the same buffer was dispensed to all wells except columns 2 and 4 and the plates were immediately transferred (< 1 min) to the Viewlux. The plates were then exposed using 405 nm excitation/520 nm emission filters for 4 sec and read at 20 sec intervals for 3 min. Final enzyme concentration was 50 nM and the final substrate concentration was 5 uM. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data calculated from slope of the linear regression of fluorescent intensity versus time (the rate). The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. Active compounds showed concentration-dependent decreases in the measured rate. Inconclusive compounds had appreciable concentration-dependent effects on both the measured rate and the interpolated basal fluorescence intensity at the start of the reaction but where the basal fluorescent intensity was marginal (e.g. < 10-fold). Inconclusive compounds also encompass highly fluorescent compounds (>100-fold increases in fluorescent intensities values relative to controls) where artificial concentration-dependent decreases in the rate occurred at high compound concentrations due to fluorescent interferences.

Description:  Shiga toxin (Stx) is released by certain strains of E. coli and is associated with food-borne gastroenteritis. In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain injury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein synthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that employed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the proteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly diminished luciferase translation. A counterscreen assay was used to identify nonspecific compounds that inhibit protein synthesis independent of Stx action. Cycloheximide (Chx) readily diffuses into cells and immediately blocks protein synthesis in the absence of Stx. Stx actives that are active in the Chx assay are thus nonspecific compounds that stabilize luciferase activity.  Six million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced and the cells infected with 3 x109  plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were incubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well cyclohemixide (1 ug/mL final concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After addition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence

Description:  Second counter screen for identification of compounds that inhibit regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4): Non-induced cells with the primary screen assay without carbachol activation To counter screen the hit compounds that inhibit the RGS4 protein from the primary screen, the Non-induced same HEK293 cell line which stably expresses M3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in non-induced RGS4 expressed cells without carbachol addition are considered non-specific hits. Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15microg/ml Blasticidin, 400microg/ml G418, 200microg/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, WITHOUT 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 microl /well of 2 microM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 microl /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 microl of 6x compounds into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors. 14. Calculate the percentage of tested compounds with the following formula: Percentage (%)=100* (Ratio(cmpd)- AvgRatio(Buffer))/(AvgRatio(Carbachol)-AvgRatio(Buffer)); Percentage(%): percentage change of compound readout over those of negative controls (Buffer), Ratio(cmpd): Integrated ratio of the test compound. AvgRatio(Buffer): Integrated Ratio average of the negative controls with Buffer, Ratio(Carbachol): Integrated Ratio of Carbachol. 15. Outcome assignment:  If the compound (the average of the duplicates of the Percentage (%,avPercent) as readout) causes more than those of negative controls (Buffer) plus 5SD of negative controls (Buffer), the compound is considered to be active (Value=2). Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (Value=1). 16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of  Int((Lg(abs([avPercent]))-0.74)*49.1). The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0. List of reagents 1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider) 2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Catalog number 10010049) 3.

Description:  Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of Galanin Receptor 2 (GALR2) In this assay Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were used. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX#-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.25 million/mL in assay media (DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX(TM)-I Supplement and 1X antibiotic mix). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension per test well of a 1536-well plate (1000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours. To the appropriate wells were then added 26 nL of test compound from the MLSCN compound library in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar and final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) followed by addition of 1 microliter of PBS as the peptide controls were diluted in PBS. The galanin positive control in PBS was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar, a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol was added (1 microliter/well). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, well fluorescence was measured on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Activation=((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/(Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound: Wells containing test compound Low_Control: Wells containing PBS High_Control: Wells containing 1 microliter of galanin. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero List of reagents: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media with phenol red and GlutaMAX(tm)-I (Invitrogen, part 10566-024) Bovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03) Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30079.03) NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050) Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070) HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080) Zeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01) Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027) 100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055).

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the N2a cell line which is derived from mouse neuroblastoma. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the N2a cells with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  6uL of HeLa miR-21-FLuc cells in assay buffer (DMEM, Invitrogen #21063-029; 10% FBS, HyClone #SH30071.03) were dispensed at 2000cells/well (3.3 x 105 cells/mL) into Greiner solid-white TC-treated 1536-well plates using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated for one hour at 37 degree Celsius, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. These assay plates were then treated with 23nL of compound or DMSO using a Kalypsys pin tool, which allows for delivery of a 24-point titration of each compound to the assay plate, with a final compound concentration ranging from approximately 40uM to 5pM. Assay plates were then incubated for 48 hours. After incubation, plates were allowed to come to RT for one hour prior to delivery of 3uL of 3X luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minute incubation to allow for cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using a ViewLux CCD imager (PerkinElmer), with an average exposure time of 2-12 seconds.

Description:  The aim of this work was to use high throughput screening of a small molecule library to identify compounds that interact with the alpha2C adrenergic receptor. The assay utilized thallium influx through G-protein Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels as a measure of alpha2C activation. Compounds were tested at 10uM final concentration against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing endogenous alpha2C and cDNAs for GIRK 1 and GIRK 2. The Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 plate reader was used to collect kinetic fluorescence intensities during treatment with the test compound. The alpha2C agonist UK-14304 (Tocris) was the positive control, and DMSO, the compound vehicle, was used as the negative control. HEK293 cells expressing alpha2C/GIRK were plated at 15,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 20mM HEPES. 384-well, black walled, clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated plates were used. After overnight incubation at 37degreesC in the presence of 5% CO2, the medium was removed and BTC-AM (Molecular Probes) dye in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)) was added. After 1hour, the dye was replaced with HBSS. Test compounds were prepared in thallium assay buffer (125mM sodium gluconate, 1mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8mM calcium gluconate, 5mM glucose, 12mM thallium sulfate, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.3). The compounds were added to the cell plate by the Hamamatsu FDSS. Each cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 10seconds, 10uL of test compound was added, and the cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 2minutes total sampling time. Each kinetic trace was normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity to correct for dye loading of the cells. The ratios were used to calculate the slope of the response after compound addition (time 15 to 24 seconds). Slope values used resulted from a linear fit with 30 iterations or with a chi squared value less than or equal to 0.0001. The slope for each test compound response was compared to the vehicle control sample, DMSO. Compounds selected as 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100' had slope values that were greater than the Cutoff_Value which was calculated as the mean of the DMSO control plus three standard deviations.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and rice alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at 440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). In the AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid, 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  Counter screen for identification of compounds that inhibit regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4): Non-induced cells with the primary screen assay. To counter screen the hit compounds that inhibit the RGS4 protein from the primary screen, the Non-induced same HEK293 cell line which stably expresses M3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in non-induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered non-specific hits. Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15 ug/ml Blasticidin, 400 ug/ml G418, 200 ug/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, WITHOUT 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2 uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 ul of 7x EC20 (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z prime factors [26] 14. Calculate the percentage of tested compounds with the following formula: Percentage (%)=100* (Ratio(cmpd)- AvgRatio(Buffer))/(AvgRatio(Carbachol)-AvgRatio(Buffer)); Percentage(%): percentage change of compound readout over those of negative controls (Buffer), Ratio(cmpd): Integrated ratio of the test compound. AvgRatio(Buffer): Integrated Ratio average of the negative controls with Buffer, Ratio(Carbachol): Integrated Ratio of Carbachol. 15. Outcome assignment:  If the compound (the average of the duplicates of the Percentage (%, avPercent) as readout) causes more than those of negative controls (Buffer) plus 5SD of negative controls (Buffer), the compound is considered to be active (Value=2). Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (Value=1). 16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of  Int((Lg(abs([avPercent]))-1.42)*145.6). The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0. List of reagents 1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider) 2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Catalog number 10010049) 3.

Description:  The aim of this work was to use high throughput screening of a small molecule library to identify compounds that interact with the alpha2C adrenergic receptor. The assay utilized thallium influx through G-protein Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels as a measure of alpha2C activation. Compounds were tested at 10uM final concentration against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing endogenous alpha2C and cDNAs for GIRK 1 and GIRK 2. The Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 plate reader was used to collect kinetic fluorescence intensities during treatment with the test compound. The alpha2C agonist UK-14304 (Tocris) was the positive control, and DMSO, the compound vehicle, was used as the negative control. HEK293 cells expressing alpha2C/GIRK were plated at 15,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 20mM HEPES. 384-well, black walled, clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated plates were used. After overnight incubation at 37degreesC in the presence of 5% CO2, the medium was removed and BTC-AM (Molecular Probes) dye in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)) was added. After 1hour, the dye was replaced with HBSS. Test compounds were prepared in thallium assay buffer (125mM sodium gluconate, 1mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8mM calcium gluconate, 5mM glucose, 12mM thallium sulfate, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.3). The compounds were added to the cell plate by the Hamamatsu FDSS. Each cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 10seconds, 10uL of test compound was added, and the cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 2minutes total sampling time. Each kinetic trace was normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity to correct for dye loading of the cells. The ratios were used to calculate the slope of the response after compound addition (time 15 to 24 seconds). Slope values used resulted from a linear fit with 30 iterations or with a chi squared value less than or equal to 0.0001. Values were scaled from 0 to 100% and fit versus compound concentration in micromolar. Compounds selected as Outcome = 'Active' and Score = '100' were fit by Prism 5.0 to a sigmoidal curve with a goodness of fit value (R2) greater than 0.5.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). These compounds were not active as positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2 and were assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.

Description:  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play vital roles in numerous cellular processes and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases, ranging from cancer to cardiovascular, immunological, infectious, neurological, and metabolic diseases. The Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) PTP is a dual-specific Erk and Jnk phosphatase, the loss of which causes specific cell cycle arrest in HeLa carcinoma cells, suggesting that VHR inhibition may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer cells without detrimental effects on normal cells. Recent studies by collaborators and us suggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of an inhibitor. The assay is developed and performed to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits reported in AID 2004. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. The VHR-catalyzed hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of compound was assayed at 30 degree celsius  in a 60 ul 96-well format reaction system in 150 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0 assay buffer having an ionic strength of 150 mM (adjusted with NaCl) and containing 1 mM DTT and 5% DMSO.  With a VHR concentration of 1 nM, and at various concentrations of the compound (between 0.1 nM and 10 uM), the initial rate at 78 uM DiFMUP concentration (Km value) was determined using a FLx800 micro plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), an excitation wave length of 360 nm and measuring the emission of the fluorescent reaction product 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (DiFMU) at 460 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme.  The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 1 using the software GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Vi/V0 = IC50/(IC50 + [I]) (Eq. 1) In this case, Vi is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I], V0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki[S]/Km.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a dicistronic plasmid containing a viral internal ribosome entry site stem-loop sequence upstream of the 5'UTR stem-loop sequence from Prion protein (PRP) fused to the luciferase gene (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to non-specific RNA stem-loop binding. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured.  1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation. Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform). In groups of 22, assay plates were delidded and stacked. They were then individually pinned with 100 nL compounds, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then moved in sets of 22 to room temperature and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then discarded.

Description:  Thyroid receptor (TR) regulates many homeostatic processes including basal metabolism, cardiovascular function, body weight, and lipid trafficking. TR modulators are potential therapeutics for obesity and hyperlipidemias but current thyroid analogs have undesirable side effects, particularly cardiac stimulation. This secondary assay characterized selected actives identified in the qHTS for Inhibitors of the Interaction of Thyroid Hormone Receptor and Steroid Receptor Coregulator 2. The human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line WRO (kindly provided by Dr. M. D. Ringel) stably expresses TRbeta and a luciferase reporter gene fused to TR response element. The addition of T3 ligand elevates expression of the TRE luciferase reporter. This assay measures the transcriptional activity of compounds. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.33 mg/ml hygromycin, 0.33 mg/ml geneticin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested and resuspended at 330,000 cells/ml in assay medium (50% DMEM 50% F-12 medium without Phenol-Red (Cellgro #16-405-CV), L-glutamine, 10% heat inactivated and charcoal treated FBS, 100 uM non-essential amino acid, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin). Cells were dispensed at 10,000 cells/30 ul/well into 384 well plates (Corning 3917) and incubated 12 h at 37 C and 5% CO2. Compounds and T3 (100nM final concentration) were added using a pin tool and plates were incubated 16 h incubation at 37 C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, plates were equilibrated at ambient temperature for 30 min, 30 ul of Bright-Glo (Promega) was added and luminescence was detected by an EnVision (PerkinElmer).

Description:  Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line. Freshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000 cells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight incubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds.  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  The transcriptional cell-based assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the pFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4 response elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids are transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell line of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear receptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the suppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such compounds hence constitute potential inhibitors of the SF-1 nuclear receptor. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration.

Description:  The aim of this work was to use high throughput screening of a small molecule library to identify compounds that interact with the alpha2C adrenergic receptor. The assay utilized thallium influx through G-protein Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels as a measure of alpha2C activation. Compounds were tested at 10uM final concentration against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing endogenous alpha2C and cDNAs for GIRK 1 and GIRK 2. The Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 plate reader was used to collect kinetic fluorescence intensities during treatment with the test compound. The alpha2C agonist UK-14304 (Tocris) was the positive control, and DMSO, the compound vehicle, was used as the negative control. HEK293 cells expressing alpha2C/GIRK were plated at 15,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 20mM HEPES. 384-well, black walled, clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated plates were used. After overnight incubation at 37degreesC in the presence of 5% CO2, the medium was removed and BTC-AM (Molecular Probes) dye in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)) was added. After 1hour, the dye was replaced with HBSS. Test compounds were prepared in thallium assay buffer (125mM sodium gluconate, 1mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8mM calcium gluconate, 5mM glucose, 12mM thallium sulfate, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.3). The compounds were added to the cell plate by the Hamamatsu FDSS. Each cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 10seconds, 10uL of test compound in absence or presence of rauwolscine (a specific alpha 2 C inhibitor) was added, and the cell plate was imaged at 1Hz for 2minutes total sampling time. Each kinetic trace was normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity to correct for dye loading of the cells. The ratios were used to calculate the slope of the response after compound addition (time 15 to 24 seconds). Slope values used resulted from a linear fit with 30 iterations or with a chi squared value less than or equal to 0.0001. Dose-response curves were fit to sigmoidal curves using Prism 5.0. Compounds selected as Outcome = 'Active' and Score = '100' showed dose-response in the absence of rauwolscine, and were inhibited in the presence of rauwolscine. 'Inactive' compounds showed dose-response in the presence and absence of rauwolscine.

Description:  The goal of this high throughput screening campaign was to identify non-cytotoxic compounds that can reverse MRP1-mediated drug resistance in a MRP1 overexpressing human tumor cell line, H69AR. We implemented a strategy to treat in the absence and presence of a subtoxic dose of doxorubicin, which is a known MRP1 substrate. Doxorubicin, for example, is approximately 80 fold less effective in the H69AR line compared with the non-resistant, NCI-H69 line. In the pilot and full library screens (AID 601, AID 602), cultured human H69AR lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM in the absence or presence of doxorubicin at a concentration of 1 uM.  Following treatment, the level of ATP, which is indicative of viable cell number, was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminescence.  Each plate contained 24 replicates of carrier treated cells which served as a negative control, sixteen replicates for 25 uM sulindac sulfide which served as a positive control for reversing resistance to doxorubicin, and 24 replicates for 6-methyl purine riboside (1 ug/ml), which served as a positive control for cytotoxicity.

Description:  Fluorescence-based counterscreen for agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for agonists of NPY-Y2. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the identification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide novel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1304), "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1697), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (AID 1359) and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704) were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 microliters of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-77, for inactive 58-0.

Description:  Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. Previously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) were screened to identity FPR ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID 520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary intracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule FPRL1 antagonists. Two major chemotype families representing the most potent FPR ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational screening techniques (2D substructure search)to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased and screened in a primary HTS FPRL-FPRL1 duplex assay, results of which have been reported separately. There were 13 compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary HTS assay (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand binding). These were tested in a dose response format in the FPR-FPRL1 duplex assay to confirm activity and determine potency. The FPRL1 dose response assay results are reported here. The FPR dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the SK-N-SH cell line which is derived from human neuroblastoma. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the SK-N-SH cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The ubiquitin-proteasome system has won the reputation of the cellular recycling center that degraded aggregated or misfolded proteins in the cell (ref. [1] and references therein). Although the ubiquitin system is now known to control many other physiological processes through regulating the turnover and activity of normal cellular proteins, the recycling or disposal function is still one of the most vital activities of the ubiquitin system. For example, the failure to degrade hill-folded or aggregated proteins in neuronal cells has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The degradation of unfolded proteins by the ubiquitin system is coordinated with the other major protein folding control system in the cell, the Hsp chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. It is believed that exposed hydrophobic regions in unfolded proteins are recognized by Hsp proteins via their beta-domains and eventually refolded. However, if refolding fails, misfolded proteins are thought to be degraded by the proteasome. Because of the multitude of binding events and associated cellular activities of Ubc13, we propose to use unbiased NMR-based screens to identify high-affinity ligands to further probe the role of this central ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in protein degradation, DNA repair and IKB alpha I kinase activation. 1. Protein expression and purification Ubc13 protein expression and purification for NMR studies.  We expressed and purified Ubc13 protein to provide the necessary protein reagents for 1D 1H NMR and  2D 15N 1H HSQC NMR studies.  Ubc13 was previously cloned into pETShin-(His)9 vector at BamH1 and Xho1 sites and transformed into BL21/DE3 E.coli cells. Proteins in either labeled (15N form for 15N 1H HSQC studies) or unlabeled (for 1D NMR studies) forms were expressed as required using either minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl or LB media, respectively.  Cells were grown at 37 oC to exponential phase (O.D ~ 0.6) and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (Bio Vectra).  The general protocol for labeled and unlabeled proteins expressed from pET vector remained the same.  Briefly, cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer consisting of 1 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme and a mixture of protease inhibitors in the form of Complete Mini-EDTA free tablets (Roche).  Lysates were incubated with Ni+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) previously washed with washing buffer consisting of 1 mM Tris, pH 7.0 and 1 mM DTT.  Proteins were eluted with imidazole (Sigma) under linear gradient conditions followed by FPLC purification (Pharmacia BioTech) on a MonoQ column using gradient conditions (0 to 1 M NaCl).  This protocol generally yielded proteins of > 90% purity.  SDS-PAGE gel analysis of labeled and unlabeled versions of Ubc13 protein purified by FPLC yielded coomasie-stained bands that corresponded to MW of ~ 17 kDa.  Gelcode blue stain reagent (Pierce) and DI water were used for staining and destaining, respectively.  Unlabeled UBC13 was supplied in 50 mM HEPES @ 7.5 buffer and labeled UBC13 was supplied in 50 mM HEPES @ 7.5 buffer containing 20% D20.  2. Compound Library Screened by NMR We have assembled a scaffold library composed of ~ 4,000 compounds. The compounds have been selected based on their anticipated use as building blocks or scaffolds components of further optimized molecules. The scaffold library has been acquired from three different sources and the chemical structures of the library have been deposited into PubChem. In line with the general NIH Molecular Libraries Screening Centers Network (MLSCN) library, we have also included a collection of 602 Natural Products (MicroSource) that could be screened by NMR 3. Screening description Ligand binding was monitored by comparing the aliphatic region of 1D 1H NMR spectra of a 20 uM Ubc13 solution (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 100% D2O; T= 300 K) in the presence and in absence of compounds tested at a final concentration of 100 uM. Compounds were initially tested at mixtures of 20, and then individual compounds for those mixtures that caused significant perturbations in the spectrum were further deconvoluted.  No significant hits were reported by this screen. Only a few natural products were identified as weak binders (500 < Kd < 1000 uM) and their site of binding verified by 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC. These are Pubchem Substance IDs: 11537556; 11537407; 11537396; 11537489; 11537422; 11537399; 11537676.

Description:  Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule antagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the chemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a role at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells, and dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a recent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal liver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in primary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the metastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation of the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases including hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis. The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as 'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important objective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer metastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. In this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay. A.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007). Gamma-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD1-mediated NF-kB pathway. NOD1 specifically detects Gamma-Tri-DAP, a tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kB pathway. Here we used GM-Tri-DAP to induce IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells. (Girardin,2003). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS luminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 1578) and followed up in "SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1" )AID 2333) to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. 1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1 2. GM-Tri-DAP (Sigma) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. GM-Tri-DAP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed. 5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve analysis.

Description:  Mineralization of cartilage and bone occurs by a series of physicochemical and biochemical processes that together facilitate the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) in specific areas of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Experimental evidence has pointed to the presence of HA crystals along collagen fibrils in the ECM and also within the lumen of chondroblast- and osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs). Dr.  Milan's  working model is that bone mineralization is first initiated within the lumen of MVs. In a second step, HA crystals grow beyond the confines of the MVs and become exposed to the extracellular milieu where they continue to propagate along collagen fibrils. Recent data have indicated that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role in restricting the concentration of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP), a mineralization inhibitor, to maintain a P/PPi ratio permissive for normal bone mineralization. Using a variety of single and double gene knockout experiments it has been found that mice deficient in TNAP function, i.e., Akp2-/- mice, display osteomalacia due to an arrest in the propagation of HA crystals outside the MVs caused by an increase in extracellular PPi concentrations. Inside the MVs, however, HA crystals are still present in Akp2-/- mice. It is hypothesize that a newly identified soluble phosphatase, PHOSPHO1, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphoserine (PS) present in the MVs, is responsible for increasing the local concentration of Pi inside the MVs to change the P/PPi ratio to favor precipitation of HA seed crystals. This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate phosphate from phosphoethanolamine and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent. 1) POSPHO1 was obtained from the assay provider's laboratory. 2) Assay Buffer: 20mM MES-NaOH pH 6.7, 2mM MgCl2, 0.0125% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA Procedure 1) Dispense 1.5ul of assay buffer into columns 1 and 2 of a black, clear bottom Corning (#3891) 1536 well assay plate. 2) Dispense 1.5ul of PHOSPHO1 (2.5ng/ml) in assay buffer to wells in columns 3 through 48. 3) Using a HighRes biosolutions pintool dispense 20nl of 2mM compounds in DMSO to columns 5-48 4) Dispense 20nl of DMSO to columns 1-4. 5) Add 1.5ul of assay buffer containing 900uM phosphoethanolamine  to all wells 6) Incubate lidded plate for 1 hour at room temp. 7) Add 3ul of Biomol 8) Incubate for 30 min to allow Biomol signal to develop 9) Read plate on a Perkin Elmer Viewlux at 630nm in absorbance mode Ex1:2 = 630 DF10 Em1:564/250(absorbance); Em2:Clear Light energy = 100000 Measurement time = 5 sec 1x binning

Description:  Lithium has been widely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. But lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and it can cause side effects such as thirst, weight gain, tremor, polyuria and memory problems. Although the mechanism for lithium action in treatment of bipolar disorder is still not fully understood, inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and the subsequent depletion of the inositol pool in living cells have been implicated as the primary therapeutic benefit of lithium therapy. Therefore, a selective IMPase inhibitor with reduced side effects might be a good drug candidate to replace lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Several IMPase inhibitors have been discovered previously. However, they are not suitable for therapeutic use because of their poor cell membrane penetrability or oral bioavailability; the development of new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors is needed. IMPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) to release free inositol. Binding of an agonist to a Gq coupled GPCR results in the activation of PLC, which hydrolyzes the PIP2 to form inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). While DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), IP3 triggers the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. The IP3 is very rapidly inactivated by hydrolysis to IP2, IP1 and then inositol by a series of enzymes including IMPase. Free inositols are used for synthesis of PI and thus start another inositol cycle. To identify new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors, we developed a cell-based IMPase assay in which the cytosolic IP1 is measured by a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. In this assay, an IP1 specific antibody is used to detect the labeled IP1 tracer. When the cell lysate contains the elevated IP1 due to the inhibition of IMPase, the TR-FRET between the labeled antibody and IP1 tracer is disrupted resulting in a reduction in the total signal. Since the TR-FRET is used, this cell-based assay is a homogenous assay without cell wash and medium change that is suitable for assay miniaturization and HTS. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (18.4 mM LiCl). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. IMPase 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Plate 4 ul/well (2000 cells) of cell suspension from frozen CHO-M1 Cells in white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates that are cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of carbachol (50 uM in stimulation buffer containing10mM HEPES, 1mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 4.2 mM KCl, 146 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 50mM LiCl, pH 7.4. (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 30 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well of d2-conjugated IP1 (d2-IP1) and 1 ul/well of Eu+ cryptate conjugated anti-IP1 antibody (Eu+-Ab) prepared in the cell lysis buffer, both from the IP-One kit (Cisbio, MA). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 'Donor' and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader. 'Ratio' = Em1/Em2.

Description:  The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay, using a construct of DnaK corresponding to only the b-domain (residues 393-507), the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their ability to inhibit the ATPase activity of DnaK. References 1. Bukau B, Weissman J, Horwich A. Cell. 2006 May 5;125(3):443-51. 2. Pellecchia M, Montgomery DL, Stevens SY, Vander Kooi CW, Feng HP, Gierasch LM, Zuiderweg ER. Nat Struct Biol. 2000 Apr;7(4):298-303. Materials: 1. The gene coding for the E. coli DnaK substrate binding (beta) domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein contains 17 extra amino acid residues (MGSSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) at the N-terminus. 2.  The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography.  3.  DnaK, human Hsp70, DnaJ, and GrpE were purchased from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). 4.  The model substrate NRLLLTG was synthesized by the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI).  Protocols: 1)  ATPase activity was monitored using the ADAPTA kit from Invitrogen. 2)  The EC80 of our expressed full-length DnaK was determined to be 2 uM. 3) Compounds were assayed in mixtures of 5 at 400 uM each for screening and the antimicrobial peptides at 40 uM.  Compounds and peptides were preincubated with DnaK for at least 10 minutes at room temperature. 4)  TR-FRET was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor 2 Multilabel plate reader. 5)  Mixtures reducing activity below 90% of DnaK alone were deconvoluted.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro cytotoxicity of small molecules. This particular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-002) purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of intracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present. Using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured in the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen, tetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist (glutamate) is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Compounds that gave a foldshift of <2.5 were assigned as 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'. For compounds with foldshift >/= 2.5 were considered positive allosteric modulators of rat mGluR8 and were assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Active' and a 'Score' of '50'. For compounds with foldshift >/= 5.0 were assinged a 'Score' of '100'.

Description:  Assessement of equilibrium binding of guanine nucleotide to the guanine nucleotide binding protein can be utilized to evaluate if a inhibitory compound is acting at the binding site of guanine nucleotide or at an alternative, allosteric site. A direct competitive inhibitor does not hinder the binding of the guanine nucleotide from reaching the maximum level of binding at high concentrations of guanine nucleotide. However, the binding of guanine nucleotide in the presense of a non-competitive inhibitor could potentially not reach the same maximum as without the inhibitory compound. In other words, the outcome of non-competitive inhibitors would be that the maximum binding sites available have been lowered. This assay were carried out to assess the mechanism of action for this compound in the condition of nascent nucleotide depletion with Mg buffer. The protein target (GST-Cdc42, 4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on GSH-beads is depleted of nascent nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA-containing buffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% detergent, NP-40, containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM MgCl2, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA. Binding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-CDC42-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with 1 milliM MgCl2 and either DMSO or 10 microM compound and subsequently adding 50 microL of varying concentration (range 0-1000 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population. Non-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were assessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP (10 microM). Calculations: The specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured at different fluorescent GTP concentrations in the presense of blocking non-fluorescent GTP (RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO): SpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP These specific binding values were then fit to an One site binding (hyperbola) equation: BoundGTP = Bmax * [GTP]/(Kd + [GTP]) where BoundGTP is the bound fluorescent GTP, [GTP] is the concentration of fluorescent GTP in nanoM, Bmax is the calculated value of maximum binding sites for GTP, and Kd is the observed affinity of GTP to the guanine nucleotide binding protein under those conditions.  PUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the different extimates of Bmax in the presense of DMSO or 10 microM inhibitory compound. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100 *(BmaxDMSO-BmaxCmpd)/BmaxDMSO where BmaxDMSO is the Bmax calculated in the presense of DMSO and BmaxCmpd is the Bmax calculated in presense of 10 microM inhibitory compound. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_SCORE greater than 50.

Description:  The P450 gene superfamily is involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This assay used human CYP2C9 to measure the hydroxylation of deoxyluciferin (Luciferin-H; P450 Glo-Buffer) to luciferin. The luciferin is then measured by luminescence after the addition of a luciferase detection reagent. Luciferin-H concentration in the assay was equal to its Michaelis constant KM for CYP2C9. Inhibitors and some substrates limit the production of luciferin, and decrease measured luminescence. Two uL of enzyme and substrate mix (final concentrations: 10nM CYP2C9, 100uM Luciferin-H, 25mM KPO4) were dispensed into a white, solid bottom 1536-well microtiter plate. 23nL of compound was transferred by a pin tool. The plate was incubated at 37C for 10 min. Two uL of an NADPH regeneration solution (Promega supplied reagent) was dispensed and the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min at 37C. Then the reaction was stopped by reconstituted P450 Glo-Buffer. After another 20 min of incubation the plate was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 60 sec exposure and 2x2 binning. This protocol was carried out with Promega-Glo reagents and further information can be found at http://www.promega.com/tbs/tb325/tb325.pdf. Data were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (57uM sulphaphenazole).

Description:  Human liver cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in cathepsin B due to research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the Ebola and SARS viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin B inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. Cathepsin B is also implicated in cancer progression. Upregulation and secretion of this enzyme occurs in many types of tumors and correlates positively with their invasive and metastatic capabilities. Cathepsin B facilitates tumor invasion by dissolving extracellular barriers. Inhibitors of cathepsin B thus have been studied as potential anti-cancer agents. The high-throughput screen for cathepsin B inhibitors reported here consisted of an end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Human liver cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219362). Substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1135.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium-potassium phosphate,  pH 6.8 (86 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, tribasic), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin B (0.065 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS was performed using 10 uM compound. HTS protocol 1.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 2.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 3.Add 200 nL of compound (0.5 mM in DMSO) using Evolution pintool 4.Add 1 uL of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 5.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.13 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 6.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 7.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse. The cannabinoid receptors (type 1 and 2) are members of the G-protein coupled receptor family and have been found to be involved in alterations in mood and cognition, as experienced by marijuana users. The specific aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in " Image-based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55 " (AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the cannabinoid receptor type 1. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the CB1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: WIN55212 (Sigma W102 25mg) - 5mM stock in DMSO).  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powders, working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1. WIN55212 (positive control) final concentration was 1uM.  c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: 40x 0.6 NA air objective  Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels  2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters  4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.  Analysis settings: Nuclei Detection Threshold Adjustment:     1.5  Nuclear Individual Threshold Adjustment:  0.45  Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7  Minimum Nuclear Area:    70  Minimum Nuclear Distance:    7  Minimum Nuclear Contrast:    0.1 Cytoplasm Detection  Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment: 0.2  Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.1 Spot Detection Spot Minimum Distance    3  Spot Peak Radius     0  Spot Reference Radius    3  Spot Minimum Contrast    0.3  Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   1 3) Metrics calculated from Nuclei Images: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus") GFP Images: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. IC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (AID 1263), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of STAT3. The compounds selected for testing in this assay met the following criteria: 1) they were active in AID 920 and AID 1263; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 862); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition" (AID 1303); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (AID 1310). In this assay STAT3 inhibition was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct.  This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 microliters of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (112 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final EC80 concentration) was dispensed into all wells. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Anesthetic development has remained a largely empirical process. There are growing concerns about the cognitive effects of known general anesthetics [1] and acceleration of the onset of neurodegenerative disease [2]. The compounds' toxicity [3] and multiple specific binding targets in the mammalian brain [4] has made them less attractive as drug leads. In this assay, a GABAergic mimetic model system, apoferritin and a profluorescent 1-aminoanthracene ligand (1-AMA), was used to construct a competitive binding assay for identification of novel general anesthetics. The assay was validated for 1-AMA using other known anesthetics, such as isoflurane (CID:3763) and propofol (CID: 4943) [5], [6].  This particular BioAssay is a confirmation of followup compounds from primary screen AID:485281. Three uL of reagents (free 1-AMA (50% saturated solution of 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 3, 4 as negative control and 1-AMA/apoferritin mixture (10 uM horse-spleen apoferritin in 50% saturated 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 1, 2, 5-48) was dispensed into 1536-well Greiner black assay plates. Compounds (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys pintool equipped with 1,536-pin array (10 nL slotted pins, V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA). Titration of the positive control, propofol, were delivered via pin transfer from separate control plates to the 2nd column of each assay plate. The starting concentration of the control, dissolved in DMSO, was at 160 mM, followed by two-fold dilution points in duplicate, for a total of 16 concentrations. The plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then read on an EnVision HTS multilabel reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) (end point read, 3 min/plate) using Fura2 BFP excitation filter (380 nm, bandwidth 10 nm) and fluorescein emission filter (535 nm, bandwidth 25 nm) set. A LANCE/DELFIA dichroic mirror with a cutoff wavelength at 400 nm was used to maximize signal accuracy and strength. Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column 5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in order to monitor for and record any shifts in the background. Activity was computed as the normalized fluorescence response relative to free 1-AMA and 1-AMA/apoferritin complex values. Concentration-effect relationships were derived by using curve fitting algorithms developed in-house (http://ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts/). A four parameter Hill equation was fitted to the concentration-response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and observed responses.

Description:  Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) are important human and/or animal pathogens that cause acute virus infections with severe diseases and/or death. Several recent human and/or animal epidemics have been caused by arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DNV) in South America and Asia, West Nile virus (WNV) in North America and Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe.  Commercially available vaccines are not available for many arboviruses and those that are available are frequently not 100% efficacious.  For example, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against WNV, which is spreading across the US.  The commercial Dengue vaccine has been under development for decades and still is not effective against all strains of Dengue viruses.  This was recently seen when a new strain of Dengue III spread through South America causing sever disease and death.  So for many arbovirus based diseases, there is no effective vaccine or chemotherapy currently available.  The need to develop antiviral drugs is critical in treating and managing disease.  BTV was selected as a prototype virus from this genus for use in developing a High Throughput Screening protocol.  It was selected because it is not pathogenic in humans, which reduces the risk associated with assay development using infectious agents.  To screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format.  The assay measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in BSR cells by BTV infection using cell viability as the end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by BTV infection involves challenging 5000 cells with BTV virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared on July 10, 2007 from BSR cells. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 72 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Cell viability was determined from intracellular ATP concentration using firefly luciferase as the reporter. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. Cell Culture: BSR cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. The cells are maintained at 37OC, 5.0% CO2 to 90% confluence. Prior to cell plating, cells were re-suspended in DMEM with 100ug/L streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L, 4mM L-glut and 1% FBS (Assay Media). BTV virus culture: The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared in BSR cells using a stock available in Dr. Qianjun Li's laboratory. Briefly, BSR cells were grown in four T75 plates to 90% confluence, and 5ml of BTV-10 virus at 105pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. After three days incubation, cells and the supernatant were harvested and the cells were pelleted.  The cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80 OC. These virus stocks were titrated in BSR cells using the TCID50 method. The titer was 1 X 108 TCID50/ml. Control and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and 5ul was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates.  Test compounds were diluted in media to 60uM with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%.  5ul was also dispensed to the assay plate.   Cell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 5000 cells/well were plated in 15uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were then transferred to the Virology HTS lab and incubated 2-4 hrs at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity. Virus Addition: BTV was diluted in media to 5,000 pfu/ml and 10ul was added to the compound wells and the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.01).  Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell control wells.  All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for 72 h within the BSL-2 laboratory. Endpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well.  Plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-2 facility.

Description:  Human lipoxygenase 15hLO-1 is a member of the closely related lipoxygenase family of enzymes which catalyze the site-specific oxidation of arachidonic acid to various hormone precursor molecules and as such is a candidate for drug development in a variety of disease areas, such as cancer and inflammation. Inhibition of 15hLO-1 activity was screened by utilizing arachidonic acid as a substrate. The extent of hydroperoxide product formation was measured by a secondary chromogenic reaction in which xylenol orange (XO, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. number 39,818-7) reacts with the ferric ions produced from the reaction between the hydroperoxide and ferrous ions. The Fe(III)-XO complex is characterized with red-shifted absorbance at 560 nm. Buffer:  25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.01% Triton X-100. Buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control (no enzyme). Substrate solution: 50 uM arachidonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) final concentration dispensed throughout the plate. Enzyme: 40 nM 15hLO-1 final concentration in columns 1, 2, 5-48. Column 1 is neutral (100% activity). Column 2 contained pin-transferred titration of NDGA (nordihidroguaiaretic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, N 5023, top concentration 10 mM in DMSO, then 1:2 dilution in duplicate). (Dilution factor: 23 nL into 4 uL.) Chromogenic detection reagent (divalent iron/xylenol orange, Fe-XO): 200 uM xylenol orange plus 300 uM ferrous ammonium sulfate prepared freshly in 50 mM sulfuric acid. Three uL of enzyme were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black clear bottom plates. Compounds and controls (23 nL) were transferred via Kalypsys PinTool. The plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then 1 uL of substrate solution was added to start the reaction. After room temperature incubation for 6 minutes, 4 uL of  Fe-XO solution was added to each well followed by a short spin (1000 rpm, 15 sec) and the plates were then incubated for 30 min. The absorbance at 405 and 573 nm were measured using ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) High-throughput CCD imager and absorbance protocol settings. The 573-to-405 absorbance ratio was used to compute reaction progress.

Description:  Addiction leading to abuse should  be treatable by pharmacological approaches, and programs that identify new drugs to treat methamphetamine abuse address an immediate goal of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that new approaches are needed for treating METH addiction. Currently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the psychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity, psychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not lead to the development of tolerance [2]. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin receptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses. We propose to identify novel small molecule neurotensin receptor agonists by screening libraries of compounds using a primary assay based upon the ability of a b-arrestin fluorescent reporter to directly recognize the activated state of the NTR1. The specific aim of this primary assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the Neurotensin 1 Receptor (NTR1) using a b-arrestin high throughput, high content primary assay. This assay is to identify agonists that activate the neurotensin receptor-1 pathway by detecting of spots of-arrestin-GFP in NTR1-U2OS Osteosarcoma Cells.

Description:  The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2). STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, members of the STAT family (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Currently available STAT1 modulators mediate modest effects on STAT-induced transcription, act indirectly by targeting JAK or other kinases activities, or are associated with adverse hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects (6, 7).  The liabilities of the current state of the art for STAT1 modulators necessitate the discovery of higher affinity probes.  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). In this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 antagonist will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence. The STAT1 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final nominal IC100 concentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control wells.  Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is required for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness). It has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the genetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity, which significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule inhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new pharmacological chaperones. This is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate and human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic substrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at 440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). In the AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. Assay buffer: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0), 0.005% Tween-20, pH 5.0. (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay) 1536-well assay protocol for the human alpha-glucosidase: (1) Add 2 ul/well of enzyme (4 nM final) (2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution. The final titration was 0.7 nM to 77 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of substrate (400 uM final) (4) Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. (5) Add 2 ul stop solution (1M NaOH and 1M Glycine mixture, pH 10) (6) Detect the assay plate in a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer) with Ex=365 nm and Em=440nm.

Description:  This project aims to identify small drug-like molecules that activate (agonists) the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) or enhance its TRH-stimulated activity (allosteric enhancers). TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders. Upon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. A cytosolic calcium indicator exhibits increased fluorescence in the presence of calcium release. This primary screen measures compound-induced enhancement of an EC20 stimulation of the receptor by its native ligand. The potency is measured by AC50, concentration at which compound exhibits half-maximal efficacy. For the HTS assay freshly prepared cells are plated at a density of 2000/well in 3 ul of complete DMEM medium containing 10% serum in 1536-well plates and cultured over night at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The next day, 2 ul of a no wash calcium dye (ABD Bioquest) was added to the cells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For the assay, assay plates were loaded into the FDSS kinetic plate reader.  A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as TRH controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Cell-based assay for inhibition of Ca2+-ionophore (A23187)-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with compounds found to show less than 50% inhibition in an SFLLRN-induced FITC phalloidin assay.  Platelet samples were incubated with 30 uM compound. Following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 10 uM A23187.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a specificity assay, along with an analogous assay using PMA-induced activation of platelets, to determine selectivity towards G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR).  Compounds that do not inhibit surface expression of P-selectin from PMA-induced and Ca2+-ionophore-induced activation are classified as potential GPCR-selective inhibitors. Primary Collaborators(and laboratory where this assay was performed): Ca2+-ionophore -induced P-selectin assay protocol: 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were incubated with 30uM compound. 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 10 uM A23187. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample.

Description:  LYP, is a lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical regulatory role in T cell receptor signaling. The PTPN22 gene encodes this phosphatase. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in PTPN22 is associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Grave's disease. The autoimmunity-predisposing allele is a gain-of-function mutant suggesting that a specific small-molecule inhibitor could eliminate its effect. This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate methyl-fluorescein from 3-O-methylflyorescein phosphate (OMFP). 1) LYP (LYPCAT) was produced at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute's protein production core facility 2) Assay Buffer: 20mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 1mM DTT, 0.005% Tween-20 3) 3-O-Methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) cyclohexylammonium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, M2629) Dose response protocol: 1) Dispense 10 ul of 600 uM OMFP in assay buffer into all columns of black 384-well small-volume Greiner plates (786076) 2) Dispense 10 uL of assay buffer in columns 1-2. 3) Using Labcyte Echo550, dispense 200 nL of serially diluted compounds to columns 3-22 and DMSO to columns 1-2 and 23-24. Final concentration of DMSO was 1 % 4) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi, dispense 10 uL of 3 nM LYPCAT working solution to wells in columns 3 through 24. 5) Incubate lidded plate for 30 min. at room temp. 6) Read plate on M5 plate reader in fluorescence mode (Ex: 480nm, Em: 520nm)

Description:  The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media (DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual volume. 6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT. 7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was a weak positive allosteric modulator of human mGluR6 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Active' and a 'Score' of '50'.

Description:  Human liver cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219362). Substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was from Bachem (Cat #I-1135.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 6.8 (86 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, tribasic), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676). Cathepsin B (0.065 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as described below. 1.Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM) 2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro 3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384 4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool 5.Add 1 uL of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro 6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.13 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384 7.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature 8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader Data analysis Data were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation: % Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)) Dose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic fit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase reticulocyte (hPK-R) enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and assayed for its ability to generate ATP from ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate. ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by luciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme was assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators. Three uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so that the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentration of 0.1 nM) in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL of detection mix (Kinase-Glo, Promega; at 4 degree Celsius protected from light) was added and luminescence read by a ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) at 1 second exposure/plate. Data were normalized to the uninhibited (row 31). Additionally, a no enzyme and 5-fold enzyme control was dispensed in row 32, split equally between the two conditions.

Description:  Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein coupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS). Activation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting coupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various tissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in modulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an unusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing anxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders. To identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the production of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET (time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer and the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating a TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The native unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding and reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled molecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be detected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was successfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format. Select compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency, efficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs of active compounds from the primary screen. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained from Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. NPS 1536-well assay protocol: (1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200 cells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours. (2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between 0.6 nM and 46 uM. (3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 uM RO-201724 (Sigma-Aldrich, B8279), 1.5% Alexa 647-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (from Perkin Elmer), 100 nM NPS) (4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min. (5) Add 1 ul/well detection reagent. Detection reagent was prepared by adding biotin labeled cAMP (4%), streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (1.33%) and TritonX-100 (1%) to detection buffer. Biotin labeled cAMP, streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate and detection buffer all came from the LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer). (6) Incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. (7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.

Description:  Human pyruvate kinase liver (hPK-L)enzyme was supplied as a highly purified (>95% pure) preparation from Harvard Medical School and a secondary assay was used to evaluate compounds. This assay couples the formation of pyruvate from hPK-R using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NADH. The depletion of NADH is followed in a fluorescent-based kinetic assay that follows the formation of pyruvate to lactate, as catalyzed LDH. Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and ADP, were present in the assay at 0.1 mM and 4 mM respectively. In this kinetic assay initial rates were determined by following the fluorescence of NADH depletion. Three uL of substrate mix (final concentration, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PEP, 4.0 mM ADP, and 0.2 mM NADH) was dispensed into black-solid 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compounds were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix (final concentrations, 10 nM hPK-L and 1 uM of LDH) was added. Plates were immediately placed in ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) and NADH fluorescence was determined at 30 second exposure intervals for between 3 and 6 minutes.  Data were normalized to the uninhibited and EC100 activation using known activators such as fructose-bis-phosphate.

Description:  This project aims to identify small drug-like molecules that activate (agonists) the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) or enhance its TRH-stimulated activity (allosteric enhancers). TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders. Upon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. A cytosolic calcium indicator exhibits increased fluorescence in the presence of calcium release. This primary screen measures compound-induced activation of calcium release. For the HTS assay freshly prepared cells are plated at a density of 2000/well in 3 ul of complete DMEM medium containing 10% serum in 1536-well plates and cultured over night at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The next day, 2 ul of a no wash calcium dye (ABD Bioquest) was added to the cells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For the assay, assay plates were loaded into the FDSS kinetic plate reader.  A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as TRH controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists). Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance abuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose contribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. The aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. This image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the MOR1 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200 ug/ml G418 and 100 ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: Damgo (Tocris Cookson #1157 - 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in water to 25 uM.  5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1.  Damgo final concentration was 1 uM. c. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%. d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm.  Analysis settings: Nuclei Detection Threshold Adjustment: 1.5 Nuclear Individual Threshold Adjustment:  0.45 Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7 Minimum Nuclear Area:    70 Minimum Nuclear Distance:    7 Minimum Nuclear Contrast:    0.1 Cytoplasm Detection Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:   0.2 Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.1 Spot Detection Spot Minimum Distance    3 Spot Peak Radius     0 Spot Reference Radius    3 Spot Minimum Contrast    0.3 Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   1 3) Metrics calculated from Nuclei Images: Cell Count (NumberofCellsAnalyzed), Nuclei Area (AreaoftheNucleus), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei (TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus), Average Intensity of the Nuclei (AverageIntensityoftheNucleus) GFP Images: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm (TotalCytoplasmIntensity), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots (TotalSpotIntensity), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities (RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity), Number of Spots per Cell (AverageSpotsPerCell), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation (PercentagePositiveCells) 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. EC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.

Description:  qHTS Assay for Inhibitors Targeting the Menin-MLL Interaction in MLL Related Leukemias Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the MLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were kindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and peptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine  (Eu3+-AB) and  the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were purchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks were stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). FP Assay Reagents: 1. FP reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT. Before use, 0.05% BSA is added. 2. Menin protein, MLL-w.t. labeled with fluorescein, MLL-mutant peptide labeled with texas red. Stored in singe use aliquots at -80C. 3. MLL-w.t. unlabeled peptide as positive control: 10 uM final in FP buffer. FP Assay Procedure: 1. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, and MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM mixture in FP buffer. 2. Prepare Menin at 200 nM, MLL-w.t.-fluorescein at 25 nM, MLL-mutant-texas red at 50 nM, and 10 uM MLL-w.t. unlabeled mixture in FP buffer. 3.

Description:  This project aims to identify small drug-like molecules that activate (agonists) the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) or enhance its TRH-stimulated activity (allosteric enhancers). TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders. Upon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. A cytosolic calcium indicator exhibits increased fluorescence in the presence of calcium release. This confirmation screen measures compound-induced stimulation of the receptor.The potency is measured by AC50, the concentration at which compound exhibits half-maximal efficacy. For the HTS assay freshly prepared cells are plated at a density of 2000/well in 3 ul of complete DMEM medium containing 10% serum in 1536-well plates and cultured over night at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The next day, 2 ul of a no wash calcium dye (ABD Bioquest) was added to the cells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For the assay, assay plates were loaded into the FDSS kinetic plate reader.  A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound library (as well as TRH controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.

Description:  Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis Bead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. Beads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). Positive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. Flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The resulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the compound activity in each well. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. Calculations: In order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25 beads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a well.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RacWT there are only 67 missing compounds. When the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound, these compounds are flagged as "Possible Green Fluorescent Compound" (see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be 'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0).  Assessment of fluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the proteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are calculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this difference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT; CompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL with RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control fluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL from the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are calculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very similar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential fluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RacWT there are only 4,083 fluorescent compounds. Due to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends), normalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound.  Whole plate trends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression.  Then due to the plate location of a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (notated with WPcalc) is utilized for calculating % activity normalized by whole plate: % Activity = 100 x (SampleFL - NCntrl)/(PCntrl_WPcalc -NCntrl) where all variables are Median Fluorescence Intensity associated with the bead set bound with a specific protein.  SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, PCntrl_WPcalc is the well-specific, calculated value based on whole plate linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is for measurement in presence 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP.  Baseline of % Activity is 100%.

Description:  LYP, is a lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical regulatory role in T cell receptor signaling. The PTPN22 gene encodes this phosphatase. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in PTPN22 is associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Grave's disease. The autoimmunity-predisposing allele is a gain-of-function mutant suggesting that a specific small-molecule inhibitor could eliminate its effect. Finding specific inhibitors of protein phosphatases has proven extremely difficult. The goal of this project is to find inhibitors of LYP using a novel assay approach developed by the assay providers. This approach uses a phosphorylated coumarin amino acid (pCAP) moiety attached to a 14-mer peptide, which is a substrate for LYP. 1) LYP (LYPCAT) was produced at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute's protein production core facility 2) 14LckpCAP394 (pCAP) was purchased from Univ. of Utah peptide synthesis core 3) Assay Buffer = 50mM Bis Tris pH 6.0, 1mM DTT, 0.1% BSA and 0.005% Tween 20.  The buffer was filtered prior to addition of enzyme or substrate. Dose response protocol: 1) Dispense 10 ul of 20 uM pCAP into all columns of black 384-well small-volume Greiner plates (786076) 2) Dispense 10 uL of assay buffer in columns 1-2. 3) Using Labcyte Echo550, dispense 200 nL of serially diluted compounds to columns 3-22 and DMSO to columns 1-2 and 23-24. Final concentration of DMSO was 1 % 4) Using Thermo Scientific MultiDrop Combi, dispense 10 uL of 2 nM LYP1 working solution to wells in columns 3 through 24. 5) Incubate lidded plate for 30 min. at room temp. 6) Read plate on M5 plate reader in fluorescence mode (Ex: 340nm, Em: 460nm)

Description:  Assay to identify inhibitors among the possible fluorescent artifacts from the primary HTS inhibition assay of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate in Assay Buffer (50 millimolar Tris-HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in Assay Buffer (same composition as above). Fluorescence was read a first time (t0) after enzyme addition on a Perkin-Elmer Viewlux microplate reader (excitation = 325nm, emission = 450nm). After 4 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence was read a second time (t4). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (test_compound_delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)/( positive_control_ delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)*100 Where positive_control is defined as test wells containing 8 micromolar MMP13 inhibitor and negative_control is defined as test wells containing DMSO only. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the confirmation screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. Also, an average and a standard deviation of three replicates were calculated. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. Reagents list: MMP13 enzyme (R&D Systems cat# 511-MM-010, Minneapolis, MN) MMP13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) MMP13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences cat# 444283, San Diego, CA) EDTA Disodium salt solution 0.5M (Sigma-Aldrich cat# E7889-100mL, St.Louis, MO) Brij35 30% solution (Sigma-Aldrich cat# B4184-100mL, St.Louis, MO) NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich cat# S3014-500g, St.Louis, MO) CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich cat# C8106-500g, St.Louis, MO) Tris-HCl (Fluka cat# 93363-100g, St.Louis, MO)

Description:  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes (mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important role in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically considered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in regulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among others.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to the conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the failure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological investigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology. Among the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due in part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. Interestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of acetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator would have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent with its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of illicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice, there remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related hypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical proof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). For compounds with an average EC50  equal to or greater than 10uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '0'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 10uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. The 'Score' for compounds with average EC50s greater than or equal to 10uM was assigned as '50' and for less than 1uM as '100'.

Description:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a dicistronic plasmid containing a viral internal ribosome entry site stem-loop sequence upstream of the 5'UTR stem-loop sequence from Prion protein (PRP) fused to the luciferase gene (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line to eliminate false positive hits due to non-specific RNA stem-loop binding. Assays were conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. Compounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were measured.  1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene fusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h). 2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro, 25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles. 5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation. Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform). In groups of 22, assay plates were delidded and stacked. They were then individually pinned with 100 nL compounds, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM. The positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]). 8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2. 9) Plates were then moved in sets of 22 to room temperature and were allowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min. 10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room temperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water bath). 11) Plates were then relidded and were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. 12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and luminescence values were collected using with 100 ms read time per well. 13) Plates were then discarded.

Description:  The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel therapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the intersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby offering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest, since they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly activate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific motifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce activation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a general bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).  Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in cells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing convenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved in inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD2 combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007). MDP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD2-mediated NF-kB pathway. Nod2 is a general sensor of peptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria (Girardin,2003). Here we used MDP to promote IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS luminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 1578) and followed up in "SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1" (AID 2072) to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. Protocol:  1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD2 2. MDP-LD (Invivogen) 3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) Protocol: 1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added into respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations. 2. MDP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter). 3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC (5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours. 4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit from BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium carbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of standards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes, 100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then sealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed. 5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve analysis.

Description:  We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) against a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This particular assay uses the SK-N-SH cell line which is derived from human neuroblastoma. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of a peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is liberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent signal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present. Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the SK-N-SH cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and staurosporine were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation (10 uM staurosporine). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.
