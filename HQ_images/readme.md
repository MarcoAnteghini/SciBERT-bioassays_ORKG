### This directory contains hight quality plots showing performances of the semi-automatic and frequency-based models for bioassays' semantification

The file SciBert_classifier_170RN.png shows performances of the semi-automatic model, generated using a subset of 170 randomly selected false annotation labels

The file FB_classifier.png shows performances of the frequence-based model, where each annotation labels is suggested accordingly to its frequence in the training set


In both figures, the Xaxes represent the proposedlabels while the Yaxes indicate the bioassays. In other words, each row inthe plot, represent a single bioassay, while each dot, corresponds to a proposed label. A correctly predicted annotation label is marked in black, while wrongly predicted ones, before the last correct annotated label, are marked in purple. After all the true annotation labels are correctly predicted the reaming dots are white.
